56,"University of Kentucky commit Jordan Griffin is a 3-star defensive back from Jonesboro High School whose best attribute is his selflessness. Outside of football, Griffin enjoys helping others by doing volunteering for various charities.

“I just try to make an impact in people’s lives and giving back,” Griffin told the AJC. “I do things a lot with FCA, with my church, anything with the school.”

Griffin’s selflessness stems from his faith and he actively seeks out to be a blessing in other people’s lives. Before school started last month, Griffin spent a day helping The Douglas Brothers Foundation provide clothes and schools supplies for children.

“It’s always a pleasure to see someone else smile,” he said. “Because you never know what’s going on in a person’s life.”

Kentucky gave Griffin his first offer during his sophomore year and has been the front-runner ever since. He committed to the Wildcats last year and has no intentions of changing his mind. Auburn and Ole Miss were Griffin’s runner-up schools.

“What stuck out the most was probably the coaching staff and what they have going on there as a program,” he said. “Just how hungry they are. That’s a big thing that I’ve always been taught. To just stay humble and stay after it and that’s one thing I see in their program.”

Here are a few things to know about Jordan Griffin:

1) What’s something people would be surprised to know about you? “I like to read stuff that brings out the inner life. Anything pertaining to life, it just gets me going…The last book I read… ‘The Hustler’s Ten Commandments’, but if you just look at the title you’ll think this is probably something about getting money, or drugs or things of that nature but it’s really not.”

2) Do you have any relatives that played college ball? “My brother (Jason Griffin) played at Fort Valley State University and I also have a brother (Dominic Alexander) at Middle Georgia State University. My cousin (Cameron Sutton) plays at Tennessee. My other cousin (Michael Gilmore) he’s an engineer so he at Alabama-Huntsville playing basketball.”

3) Why’d you commit so early? “They were the first to offer and I’ve known coach (Derrick) Ansley for a while. He recruited one of my cornerbacks that played with me, one of my peers Cameron Sutton. It just kind off took a toll on me. I went up there multiple times and I got a great feel for the coaching staff, fans, the school in general and kind of just fell in love with it.”

4) Who motivated you to play football? “Coming in eighth grade and ninth grade, I didn’t like football at all. I was the local basketball good player in middle school, so I wanted to play basketball. Just seeing what my brother went through… just seeing him wake up in the morning and at night and running sprints with him around the neighborhood. And just seeing him play, that made a big impact in my life and that’s why I continue to play the game of football. Just seeing how God did that for my life. Blessed me with a scholarship through him and seeing how (Jason’s) work ethic was just pushed me over the top…Without him I wouldn’t be at this point at all.”"
194,"After so much ado about an interest rate increase in the United States, strategists say the U.S. central bank should stop hesitating and finally turn the page on its monetary policy.

The upcoming rate hike by the Federal Reserve, first supposed to come early this year and now expected by December, has been so anticipated by global financial markets that, when it happens, it may be followed by a decline in risk aversion and help support battered emerging currencies.

The idea, which has also taken hold among policymakers elsewhere, goes against conventional wisdom: higher interest rates in the United States reduce the appeal of other assets worldwide and would potentially give the U.S. another boost after a year-long rally. U.S. interest rates have been at rock-bottom for so long, since late 2008, that many warn for the risk of unintended consequences, especially considering the novelty of such a move for a whole new generation of traders.

For many quarters, the so-called liftoff was deemed the greatest risk for emerging markets. But as China’s market woes started to catch eyeballs, many have begun to wonder if a September rate hike would really be that bad.

This is not just a feeling. Studies on previous rate hikes show that once the Fed moves, the dollar tends to stabilize or even depreciate in the following months, according to Gabriel Gersztein, strategist with BNP Paribas.

This theory has appealed to central bankers gathered for the annual powwow in Jackson Hole last weekend. Mexican central banker Agustin Carstens said a rate hike would be “very good.”

Much will depend, of course, on what’s next. Turning the page on the first rate increase will reduce uncertainty only if the next steps are as well telegraphed as the first one, and more importantly, if there are only small, if any, rate hikes in the pipeline for the near future. For most analysts polled by Reuters, it is “important” or “very important” that the Fed raise rates soon if the dollar is to push much higher.

Not raising rates on September 17 and waiting until October or December – as most strategists have started to bet – also does not necessarily mean emerging market currencies will weaken. That will also depend substantially on China and the outlook for commodities prices.

But if anything, an assertive Fed could instill confidence among investors. The recent turmoil, after all, would have not been scary enough to change the Fed’s flight plan."

233,"Robert Chote, the chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), is expected to serve a second term as the head of the Government's fiscal watchdog after Chancellor George Osborne backed his re-appointment.

Mr Chote became the OBR's first permanent chairman in 2010 after the independent body was set up by Sir Alan Budd, a former Bank of England rate setter.

Mr Osborne said on Thursday: ""Robert has admirably led the OBR with intelligence, independence and integrity. Undoubtedly the best person for the job, I hope that the Treasury Select Committee will approve Robert’s re-appointment so that he can continue to lead the OBR for many more successful years to come.""

Mr Chote said he was ""delighted"" to be asked to continue as OBR chairman. ""I hope that we have been able to shed light on the darker recesses of the public finances, helping Parliament and civil society to hold the Government to account for its management of fiscal policy,"" he said.

Mr Chote will appear before the Treasury Select Committee (TSC), led by Andrew Tyrie MP, in the coming weeks for final approval.

It came as a Treasury review of the OBR's framework recommended that the watchdog produce a new “fiscal risks” report highlighting how economic shocks and structural challenges could impact government revenues and spending.

The OBR will also be required to produce more analysis on long-term fiscal sustainability issues, as Britain faces a demographic challenge and pressure on public services like the NHS.

It warned in June that Britain's growing pensions and long-term care bill meant the Government would need to borrow to plug the gap between revenues and spending from 2023-24, even if the economy continues to grow at a robust pace.

While the OBR has since adjusted its near-term forecasts, its June asssessment highlighted how productivity growth, migration and ageing would affect the public finances.

The OBR has also been asked to improve its website in order to make data more accessible.

Responding to the recommendations, Mr Chote said: ""I am very pleased that the government has put forward an ambitious set of recommendations to strengthen our current operations and to widen and deepen our scrutiny of the public finances.

""I hope very much that the government will provide us with the resources that we would need to deliver on them.""

572,"THE total estimated value of Fi­ji's production and services last year reached $6.4billion, an incr­e­ase of 5.3 per cent over 2013.

This, according to the Fiji Bureau of Statistics, was estimated using 2011 prices and reflected the net value of goods and serv­i­ces produced in the country.

Government statistician Epeli Waqavonovono said last year's po­sitive economic growth was driven by a number of industries such as transport and storage sector, which contributed 1.9 percentage points, and financi­al and insurance activities, wh­i­­ch contributed 1.2 percentage points.

He said other industries inc­l­uded public administration and defence, which contributed 0.7 percentage points, manufacturing with 0.3 percentage points and education contributing 0.3 percentage points.

""Growth in these industries helped attain an overall growth of 5.3 per cent despite declines in the mining and quarry, and agriculture industries,"" Mr Waqavonovono said.

""In terms of main movements by industry in 2014, agriculture was down 2.4 per cent due to decreases in production of taro, yam and coconut. Forestry was up 19.1 per cent due to increases in the production of pine and native forest logs while fishing recorded a growth of 1.4 per cent due to mainly increased production in offshore marine fishing.""

In terms of construction, the sector grew by 9 per cent mainly because of an increase in non-general government activities while electricity was up 0.4 per cent.

Meanwhile, mining and quarrying recorded a decline of 2.4 per cent, mainly because of lower gold production while water supply and sewerage grew by 5.4 per cent."
1210,"Goldman Sachs upgraded Hikma Pharmaceuticals to ‘buy’ from ‘neutral’, added the stock to its regional stock 'focus list’ and lifted its price target to 2,840p from 2,210p.

“We see the acquisition of Roxane Labs as the realisation of large transformational M&A that we had expected to be a key catalyst.”

GS said the deal makes Hikma the sixth-largest player in the US generics market and offers potential to further improve its market position, with the acquired high-value pipeline playing a key role.

The bank said the current share price does not reflect Hikma’s accelerated growth profile. It noted that the stock trades at a 20% discount to global generic peers, which it believe is not justified and suggests re-rating potential.

“Though Hikma’s share price has increased 11.3% since announcement of the deal, we believe this does not fully reflect the potential offered by the acquired portfolio, the extensive pipeline, R&D capabilities, and increased manufacturing capacity.”

Goldman said accelerated top-line growth together with synergies likely to be realised and cost savings from economies of scale and improved operational leverage should help Hikma deliver an 18% EBITDA compound annual growth rate over 2016-18.

2046,"An accountant hired last month by Riverhead Town to replace a deputy financial administrator was a partner in the disgraced auditing firm involved in the Roslyn school district scandal a decade ago — where Riverhead financial administrator William Rothaar was then employed as district treasurer.

Rothaar, who participated in interviews conducted by a two-member town board committee, did not disclose his past professional relationship with the accountant, Donald Pearce,  who was selected by the committee from three applicants and then appointed to a $90,000-per-year “principal accountant” position by the board in a split vote at its Aug. 4 regular meeting.

Four of the five town board members, including Riverhead Supervisor Sean Walter, said Rothaar did not disclose he had worked with Pearce’s former firm,  Miller, Lilly and Pearce. (The fifth town board member could not be reached for comment.) The firm for more than a decade had been the outside auditing firm for the scandal-plagued Roslyn school district, where Rothaar held the part-time position of district treasurer from 1999 to 2004.

During that time, according to prosecutors and the state comptroller, the district superintendent, assistant superintendent for business and an account clerk, stole millions of dollars of public funds. The fraud included using public money to pay for personal expenses, including auto, mortgage and credit card payments and vacations, as well as misappropriating funds to falsified vendor accounts, and overpaying salary and benefits to the superintendent, various assistant superintendents and the account clerk, according to the state comptroller’s report.

Neither Pearce nor Rothaar were charged with any wrongdoing.

A perfect storm of sloppy neglect left fraud undetected

 The state comptroller said the fraud could occur because the school board had “abdicated its oversight role and essentially did not monitor the district’s financial operations,” according to an audit report.

“Two employees who could have identified the apparent misappropriation, the internal claims auditor and the treasurer, were not doing their jobs to ensure that only appropriate and authorized payments were being made.

“The external auditor, the CPA firm that audited the district once a year, had conflicts of interest and performed an audit that was so flawed and so far below professional standards that it failed to identify the millions that were apparently misappropriated,” the comptroller said in its report.

The work of Miller, Lilly and Pearce “was so appallingly inadequate that it would shock anyone associated with the auditing profession and certainly the taxpayers who depend on the firm to safeguard their money,” then-comptroller Alan Hevesi told the New York Times in January 2005.

“The fraud was so pervasive that it would have taken significant effort not to uncover it. Even a rudimentary review of disbursements and canceled checks would have revealed many instances of wrongdoing.”

The Roslyn school district replaced both Pearce’s firm and Rothaar in 2004.

Pearce’s partner, Andrew Miller, was charged with tampering with public records and served six months in jail.

Rothaar: ‘innocent people like myself got a bad rap’

 While Rothaar served as district treasurer, his full-time job was deputy finance administrator for Brookhaven Town, a post he held for 12 years.

The district treasurer post was a $3,000-a-year post, Rothaar said in an interview Wednesday evening. He said his job responsibilities were limited to reviewing the district’s bank reconciliations, checking them through the general ledger and giving the school board cash reports and cash-flow reports.

“My job was verifying that the cash was right,” Rothaar said. “It was the internal claims auditor’s job to  look at all the documentation.”

The Roslyn scandal was “something that innocent people like myself got a bad rap for,” Rothaar said.

Pearce, he said, was not involved in the Roslyn school district at all, which was Miller’s assignment. Rothaar said he and Pearce never worked together, though they knew each other in professional circles and had attended some of the same continuing professional education courses.

Miller, Lilly and Pearce was at one time the outside auditor for 55 school districts on Long Island and in the lower Hudson Valley, including the Riverhead Central School District, where it was retained for 10 years, until the Roslyn scandal broke in 2004. The firm was also the outside auditor for the William Floyd School District, where five officials, including the district treasurer and his assistant superintendent for business, were accused in 2005 of stealing about $1.5 million in school funds. Millions more were improperly spent due to lack of appropriate internal controls, according to a scathing audit report by the state comptroller.

Miller Lilly and Pearce was dissolved. Miller, surrendered his CPA license after he was charged with tampering with public records.

Rothaar was terminated by the Town of Brookhaven in 2006, when Democrat Brian Foley took office as supervisor. In April of that year, when Riverhead financial administrator, Jack Hansen, went on sick leave, the town hired Rothaar as a $75-a-hour consultant, working four days a week. He was later hired as full-time financial administrator.

Riverhead board members: Rothaar should have told us

 Pearce’s connection to Rothaar was news to Riverhead Town Board members, including at least one of the two who interviewed the three “finalists” for the position.

“I knew they knew each other on a professional level but not to that extent,” Councilman James Wooten said this afternoon. “Bill [Rothaar] said he knew him but that it was through conferences they attended together or something like that,” Wooten said. “He never said they knew each other from Roslyn. That bothers me a lot.”

The other board member who did the interviews was Councilman John Dunleavy, who could not be reached for comment this afternoon. Dunleavy abstained from the vote on Pearce’s appointment Aug. 4, stating a concern that the annual salary recited in the resolution was different from what he recalled having agreed to in a board executive session.

Wooten said there were three finalists interviewed. Pearce’s experience as Port Jefferson Village treasurer, where he was working before Riverhead hired him, stood out, Wooten said.  But the councilman said he was disturbed not to have been told of a prior work relationship between Rothaar and a firm in which Pearce was a partner, especially in the context of the Roslyn scandal.

Councilman George Gabrielsen and Councilwoman Jodi Giglio echoed Wooten’s concerns about Rothaar not disclosing the past relationship.

Giglio said she voted against the hire because she doesn’t think the town should fill the vacancy in the accounting office. The second accountant position was created in 2009 at the suggestion of the town’s outside auditing firm, Albrecht, Viggiano, Zureck & Company and hired Scott Harrington to fill the post.

“This guy came out of nowhere. There’s no list. We hired him provisionally. I didn’t like anything about him and I didn’t think that the vetting process was done properly,” Giglio said yesterday.

“I thought if we were going to hire anyone it should be a Riverhead resident,” she said, noting that a highly qualified candidate from Wading River was one of the other finalists interviewed.

The applicant Giglio referred to was a woman who is presently employed at a NYC firm where she earns twice as much as what she’d be paid by the town, according to board members, who  said yesterday they didn’t think she’d be “a good fit” for the town and didn’t think she’d remain satisfied with such a significant pay cut.

That thought process, according to the councilwoman, “makes no sense.”

“When we took office in 2010, the town was five years behind in its audits,” Giglio said.  “A half a million dollars later, we’re caught up and we have one CPA in the office, Rothaar, and that’s enough.”

As of January 2010, the town actually had audited financial statements complete through 2007, AVZ having produced the audited statement for 2007 on Dec. 30, 2009. It was unable to finish the 2008, 2009 and 2010 audited financial statements until 2011. Officials blamed the backlog on the retirement of the town’s longtime financial administrator in 2006, and the replacement in 2007 of the town’s longtime auditing firm, Markowitz Fenelon & Bank P.C. with AVZ after Rothaar was hired full-time that April. The town hired outside accounting and bookkeeping firms to help bring its books up to date.

‘We can’t condemn anybody with guilt by association’

 Walter yesterday said he was “not happy” about Rothaar not disclosing that it was Pearce’s firm at the center of the Roslyn school district scandal. But the supervisor defended the financial administrator and the newly hired accountant.

“Pearce is a great guy and seems very capable. They interviewed him. They did a background check on him,” Walter said.

“If he did something wrong, he would have been either arrested or he would have lost his CPA license,” he said. The same is true of Rothaar, he said.

“You can’t hold somebody accountable because people around him did something bad. We can’t condemn anybody with guilt by association.”

Nevertheless, he said, Rothaar should have made the past association known to the board.

Rothaar said last night in hindsight, he would have to agree and he regrets that he did not.

“He was not involved, though he was part of the firm,” he said of Pearce. “There was nothing secret about it. He put the firm’s name on his resume. He disclosed it.

“I knew he had no culpability and he was the best qualified for the job, not only in my eyes but in the eyes of everyone in the interview. I didn’t want to throw his name out there for something he was innocent of. The man is qualified and he’s done nothing wrong,” Rothaar said.

“I did what I thought was best at the time.”"

637,"The U.S. unemployment rate fell to 5.1%, about half of the 10% level hit during the Great Recession.

While it was a healthy sign, actual job creation by employers sent more of a mixed message.

The economy added 173,000 jobs in August. While it was a decent gain in jobs for the month, the number was below economists' expectations and is likely to muddy the picture for the Federal Reserve's historic decision to raise its key interest rate in two weeks.

Economists surveyed by CNNMoney projected that the economy would add 207,000 jobs.

Wages grew 2.2% in August, about in line with expectations but well below the Federal Reserve's 3.5% target.

Wage growth has been missing during the U.S. economic recovery from the recession, and it's also a key measure of inflation -- something that's been absent and that the Fed badly wants to see.

Overall the job numbers in August add more uncertainty surrounding a potential rate hike from the Federal Reserve in two weeks. Fed officials have said they wanted to see key economic data like the jobs report before deciding on a rate hike. Although the U.S. economy has been good, this report is not a resounding victory for the American economy.

Concerns about a global economic slowdown and volatility in stock markets had already lowered the chance of a rate hike in September. This jobs report reinforces those concerns.

It would be the Fed's first rate hike in almost a decade and a sign of a healthy U.S. economy. A rate hike will matter to millions of Americans on a range of topics, and it will be a major event for world financial markets. But it may not come in two weeks."

WATCH FOR: 8:30 a.m. EDT. Aug. Nonfarm Payrolls and Unemployment. [Payrolls expected 220,000 vs. 215,000 in July. Unemployment expected 5.2% vs. 5.3% in July.]

The tumult of the past two weeks has raised the bar for a September rate increase.

The Federal Reserve has long said the strength of the labor market is key to its decision to increase rates. And for months, economists expected August’s Nonfarm payrolls to provide the Fed with its final go ahead.

But with markets around the world whipsawing, the central bank has a lot more to consider now.

“After the July FOMC, we thought that the Fed lift-off decision was 75% NFP [Nonfarm payrolls] and 25% everything else,” said Steven Englander, global head of G10 foreign exchange strategy at Citigroup Inc. “Now we would think that the September lift-off decision is 40% NFP and 60% everything else.”

Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect 220,000 jobs were added last month. That’s in line with trend and should meet the Fed’s threshold of “some further improvement” in the jobs market in order for it to increase rates.

The question is to what extent global market turbulence and continued low inflation outweigh steady gains in the jobs market in the Fed’s call on liftoff.

“We think it is more likely that investors will see a weak number as a definitive ‘no’ to September lift-off than a strong number would guarantee a ‘yes’, despite the history of upward revisions,” said Mr. Englander.

A weak number may well be in the cards. Payrolls in August typically miss expectations on the first print by a little over 60,000, according to economists at Deutsche Bank. But the month has also seen the largest upward revisions lately with the final figure being higher in eight of the last nine years by an average 66,000, said research firm Wrightson ICAP.

The usual noise embedded in the August payroll report is something for the Fed to be mindful of when determining when to up rates.

Mr. Englander thinks a miss to the tune of 185,000, plus downward revisions to prior months, would keep the Fed on hold. “On the upside a 235k with upward revisions would be good enough for the Fed to want to lift-off, but may not be good enough to guarantee September, if they are concerned about global economic and financial conditions,” he said.

Johnson High School freshmen, have been close friends since kindergarten so working on this together was especially meaningful. 

 

 The three girls have volunteered at the Clark Nursing & Rehabilitation Center in Clark, New Jersey at 1213 Westfield Ave., for three years, entertaining residents with dance, musical performances and games. Their interaction with and affection for residents inspired the idea for their service project. They realized that some residents, many in wheelchairs, may have enjoyed gardening, but age, declining health and physical limitations make it difficult. So the girls set about designing a mobile, flexible gardening cart, built to Americans With Disability (ADA) specs, with removable planting trays, so residents can enjoy gardening and living with beautiful, seasonal plants and flowers year round in their sunny community recreation room. 

 

 The project began early this year with the girls drafting, negotiating and redrafting several designs before finally settling on one. They used recycled wood and began to assemble the cart in May, learning how to use various hand and power tools safely in the process. They also shopped for supplies, paying for some of it with money they had earned babysitting. The trio put time into the project whenever they could over the summer. Finally, after many hours of planning, shopping, building, sanding and staining, and changing things that weren't going quite as planned, the cart was completed in late July. 

 

 The girls delivered the cart on Sept. 2, to Clark Nursing & Rehabilitation Center. They planted with the residents, filling the cart with beautiful fall mums and a few annuals to brighten residents' days throughout the fall. Schifferstein's Farm and Shop Rite of Clark should also be acknowledged for generously donating some of the plants needed for their project.

The girls plan to continue volunteering at the center, and will rotate plants seasonally. They are already planning to plant Poinsettias in December, Pansies in early spring, and pretty summer annuals in May or June.

1097,"We see strong pressure on both Diageo and SABMiller management to create value for shareholders. In our [recent] SABMiller review we discussed potential benefits from a more entrepreneurial culture as well as margin upside from a tighter focus on costs. In our Diageo review we investigated ways to create value through spinning off businesses such as beer or Reserve Brands.

[But] would it be enough in a world in which forex and slower macroeconomic conditions are creating more headwinds for profit growth? A report in the UK press (Sunday Times, 29 August) that SABMiller has been consulting new advisors about a possible bid defence appears to show that the company feels under threat still from a bid from AB InBev; for Diageo, updating for forex moves last week, we now estimate slightly negative earnings per share growth this year in what was supposed to be a recovery year.

That made us think about SABGEO, a merger of equals of Diageo and SABMiller. Some 17 years on, we would see this as a similar move to the creation of Diageo from the merger of Guinness and Grand Metropolitan in 1998. We estimate that with around 50/50 emerging and mature market split of profits, a merged group could offer a firmer profit base in uncertain times (for SABMiller holders) and potentially increase its growth profile in the longer term (for Diageo holders).

Although Diageo is now making less of its total beverage alcohol strategy, we believe that a more balanced portfolio of beer and spirits could produce material upside. With broadly similar market capitalisations, we see such a deal adding 18% to combined net profits, assuming £1bn of cost synergies and some benefit on tax, with minimal regulatory issues to subtract value. There is potentially further upside from revenue synergies, and scope for a higher rating for a better balanced business. In addition, for the two large shareholders in SABMiller (Altria and Santo Domingo families), we believe a merger would preserve their tax status while giving smaller shareholdings in a more liquid investment."

298,"Metro Manila (CNNPhilippines) — For a fifth consecutive year, international business magazine Global Finance has named Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) Governor Amando Tetangco, Jr. as one of the world's best central bankers.

In its Central Bank Report Cards for 2015, the publication gave Tetangco its highest mark — an ""A"" — along with eight other central bank chiefs, such as the EU's Mario Draghi, Taiwan's Fai-Nan Perng, and Malaysia' Zeti Aziz.

On the other hand, the United States' Janet Yellen, Saudi Arabia's Fahad al-Mubarak, and Colombia's José Escobar were ranked a notch below with an ""A-"" grade.

This marks the seventh time for Tetangco to receive such a citation. He was also given the highest grade in 2006 and 2007.

“Global economies are starting to recover. This comes despite a number of challenges, including a strengthening US dollar and the end of the Federal Reserve’s easy money policy,"" said Jospeh Giarraputo, Global Finance's publisher and editorial director.

""Central bankers remain crucial in overcoming these hurdles. Sound monetary policies can dampen the effects of currency swings and rising interest rates — and thus spur economic growth.""

The publication's grades are based on an economy's performance on areas such as inflation control, economic growth goals, current stability, and interest rate management."
2052,"Ubiquiti Networks has been defrauded of more than US$46 million by scammers who spoofed its communications.

The heist was revealed in an SEC Form 8-K filing.

Apart from the financial information, details are scant. The San Jose company says: “The incident involved employee impersonation and fraudulent requests from an outside entity targeting the Company’s finance department. This fraud resulted in transfers of funds aggregating $46.7 million held by a Company subsidiary incorporated in Hong Kong to other overseas accounts held by third parties.”

Ubiquiti says it's recovered $8.1 million of the heist and has launched legal action to chase a further $6.8 million, with the remaining $31.8 million subject to US and overseas law enforcement investigations.

Brian Krebs says the fraud is based on the scammers spoofing communications from the firm “in a bid to initiate unauthorized international wire transfers”.

Rather than a breach of its IT systems, Krebs says, the modus operandi seems to be similar to other attacks: e-mails spoofing the address of an executive (such as a CEO) instruct employees to make the funds transfers.

Ubiquiti says its audit committee and outside advisers have, perhaps unsurprisingly, concluded that there are “material weaknesses” in its “internal control over financial reporting”.

While it's unsure whether it has insurance coverage for the losses, the company also says “this matter will result in some additional near-term expenses,” but it “does not expect this incident to have a material impact on its business”.

The SEC filing notes that Ubiquiti's chief accounting officer has resigned, with an interim replacement appointed. ®

912,"KARACHI: Pakistan’s leading private sector steel manufacturer Amreli Steels Limited is all set to launch its initial public offering (IPO) in mid-September and hopes to raise Rs3.37 billion for the expansion of its reinforcement bars’ manufacturing, a company’s official said.

“We are offering 74 million shares; 75 percent of which will be offered to institutions and high net-worth individuals and the rest to general public,” said Hadi Akberali, director at Amreli Steels.

”We are expecting a full subscription and the offer price, based on fundamentals, is likely to settle somewhere around Rs50/share.”

However, the rebar maker is not completely relying on its upcoming IPO to expand business and has already requested a syndicated loan of Rs1.5 billion from UBL and Askari Bank.

“Expansion in our manufacturing facility will be complete by December 2016, raising our production capacity to 480,000 tons/year,” Akberali said. The company's current production capacity stands at 180,000 tons/year.

The steelmaker is betting on a potential boom in demand for the alloy in the wake of China’s pledged investment for the development of China-Pakistan economic corridor.

Recently, China signed $28 billion deals with Pakistan as part of a planned $45 billion economic corridor. The deals are related to the construction of power plants and dams.

He said there will be a huge demand for grade iron and steel for the corridor project.

He added that the government should encourage entrepreneurs to invest in the steel sector by giving them incentives.

Akberali welcomed the growth in remittances, which is boosting consumer spending in the $232 billion economy.

He said GDP growth is jacking up steel demand.

Moreover, he added that lower oil prices and resultant lower import bill has allowed the government to push up spending on public sector development programme.

“Pakistan will benefit around $3.2 billion from the lower oil prices this year and this will go to the construction sector,” he said.

Akberali said international steel prices have dropped around 25 percent since January, but the impact could not be passed on to consumers in the same proportionate because of higher taxes.

He said steelmakers pay Rs9.0/kWh (kilowatt hour) as sales tax on energy consumption.

More than 100 steel makers are operating in the country, while steel is also imported.

“The market is flooded with substandard quality of iron and steel products as well as imported goods,” he said, adding although this doesn’t bite the company’s market share.

Akberali said the company planned a coal-based power generation plant primarily to meet their own energy requirement. “The surplus will be transferred to national grid,” he added."

2344,"Interestingly, even ADR has failed to collect information on what exactly the term ""sale of coupons"" stands for. ""We had filed applications under the RTI Act with political parties and the income tax department but are yet to get any clarification.

Nine months after the Election Commission asked all the major national political parties to file details of their income for the year 2013-14, the BJP is yet to furnish the same. However, as per analysis of details filed by five parties, 57% of the total income during the FY 2013-14 came from sale of coupons; donations, however, formed 22% of the income of the parties, revealed a survey report released by NGO Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR).

Interestingly, even ADR has failed to collect information on what exactly the term ""sale of coupons"" stands for. ""We had filed applications under the RTI Act with political parties and the income tax department but are yet to get any clarification. While political parties chose not to respond, the I-T department said it had not carried out any assessment proceedings to confirm the same,"" the ADR spokesperson told dna.

The Election Commission of India (ECI), in its letter dated November 19, 2014, issued to the president/general secretary of all political parties, stated that it was mandatory for the parties to submit details of their audited report to the ECI. The report analyses the total income and expenditure incurred by the national parties during FY 2013-14, as declared by the parties in their I-T returns submitted to the ECI.

As per the NGO, the due date for submission of annual audited accounts for the parties was November 30, 2014. Out of the six national parties, BSP, CPI, CPM and NCP submitted their audited report, while the INC submitted its report under protest, stating that unless necessary amendments were made in the RP Act, 1951, the ECI did not have the power to demand such reports from the parties. The BJP, in a letter sent in July 2015, had requested for 4 weeks' time but is yet to file the required reports.

A comparison of total donations declared by the parties in their I-T returns (both above and below Rs20,000) and that declared in the donations report shows that only 41% of the total donations of the parties came from voluntary contributions above Rs20,000. A total of Rs111.29 crore (59%) of the total donations to national parties was collected during FY 2013-14 from donors whose details are not available in the public domain.

""Full details of all donors should be made available for public scrutiny under the RTI Act. Some countries where this is done are Bhutan, Nepal, Germany, France, Italy, Brazil, Bulgaria, the US and Japan. In none of these countries is it possible for 80% of the source of funds to be unknown, but at present it is so in India,"" the ADR spokesperson said.

Total income

 The five national parties, whose I-T returns are available in the public domain, have declared a total income of Rs844.71 crore, collected from all over India.

 The INC has shown the highest income — Rs598.06 crore — during FY 2013-14. This formed 70.8% of the total income of the five national parties together.

 The CPM declared the second-highest income of Rs121.87 crore which forms 14.43% of the total income of the national parties."

2416,"The Bank of Nova Scotia (NYSE:BNS) met analyst expectations in its third fiscal quarter, generating net income of CA$1.85 billion, or CA$1.45 per share, in line with the average Reuters' analyst estimate of CA$1.45.

The Canadian bank's shares have been under pressure in 2015 as investors ponder its exposure to a slowing Canadian economy, a cooling real estate market, and a loan book that is more heavily dedicated to oil and gas companies.

Breaking the bank apart

 Scotiabank has three main segments: Canadian banking, international banking, and global banking and markets.

Its Canadian banking segment held up well. Adjusted net income grew 15% year over year, with deposits up 3% and net interest margins jumping 8 basis points from 2.17% to 2.25% from last year. Helping its net interest margins is a focus on growing its credit card balances, which generate higher margins. Personal and credit card loans grew 9.3% over the year-ago period.

International banking continues to be Scotiabank's largest growth-driver. The company reported that net income grew 11% year over year on a 12% increase in revenue. Its loan book is also growing at a double-digit clip, swelling 13% year over year.

Global banking and markets was one of its laggards in the third quarter. Net income fell 20% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2014. Total revenue in the segment dropped 14% compared to the prior year, due mostly to an 18% decline in the company's non-interest income. Non-interest income is primarily earned from trading commissions and underwriting fees, which tend to be volatile from quarter to quarter. Year-to-date revenue is down by only 5% from the same period last year.

Risks and rewards

Scotiabank is more heavily invested in international banking and oil lending than its Canadian peers. This quarter, executives helped quantify the potential risks internationally and in its oil loan book.

For the first time ever, the company broke out its exposure to Puerto Rico, noting that only 1.3% of its total loans come from the territory.

On the conference call, Scotiabank executives noted that they believed loan losses from oil-related loans would be minimal. Only about 2.5% of its oil loans were on its watch list, and most of those were to oil service companies, which have been hit particularly hard by declining oil prices. Management specifically noted that its loans to pipeline and refining companies were performing well and that it expected minimal or no losses on most of its oil-related loans. Loans to energy companies make up 3.4% of its total loans outstanding, according to its third-quarter filings.

Investors should continue to watch how its loan impairments develop over time. Gross impaired loans jumped 10% in Canada and 25% internationally despite lower loan growth of 3% and 13% in Canada and internationally, respectively.

Earnings through the first nine months of the year clocked in at CA$4.22 per share, down from CA$4.57 in the first nine months of 2014. Despite this, Scotiabank increased its quarterly dividend by roughly 3% to CA$0.70 per quarter, up from CA$0.68 per quarter.

259,"BMI View: Economic headwinds and political pressures to sustain spending will see Uruguay's fiscal deficit remain wide by historical standards in 2015 and 2016 . Nevertheless, stronger growth and a government committed to fiscal sustainability will see the shortfall gradually narrow in the coming years.

We forecast that the Uruguayan government's fiscal shortfall will amount to 3.0% of GDP in 2015 and 2.8% in 2016, wider than the average of 1.4% seen over the past decade, but an improvement from the 3.4% reported in 2014. Elevated spending on social programmes and public sector wages will persist amid significant political pressure, while revenues have declined in recent months due to the economic headwinds facing the country. Over the coming years, real GDP growth will rebound - we forecast growth of 4.2% in 2016 and 4.7% in 2017, up from 3.5% in 2014 and a forecast of 4.0% in 2015 - supporting a gradual narrowing of the budget shortfall as revenues increase.

Uruguay has seen its revenues decline in recent months, with total central government revenues in June growing by 9.8% y-o-y on a rolling 12-month basis, compared to an average of 13.1% y-o-y over the past decade. Sales tax has been hampered by declines in consumer purchasing power, which has deteriorated significantly in recent months, illustrated by an inflation rate of 9.0% y-o-y in July, compared to a recent low of 7.4% y-o-y in February. This is due in part to the Uruguayan peso, which has depreciated by 14.7% against the US dollar since the beginning of the year, raising the price of goods sourced from abroad. At the same time, Uruguay's most important export market, Brazil, has seen its currency depreciate even more rapidly, raising the cost of the Uruguayan goods for Brazilian consumers, weighing on national income growth.

We expect that global headwinds will gradually diminish in the coming years, and that the reduced risk appetite among international investors will see an increase in interest for countries like Uruguay, with strong institutions and a reputation for political stability. As a result, revenues will climb and the country's fiscal shortfall will return to historical trends of around 2.0% over the next five years.

On the other side of the equation, expenditures will remain relatively elevated, particularly in 2015 and 2016. President Tabare Vazquez, who came to power less than six months ago, can ill-afford to lose his political mandate so early in his term, and is under increasing pressure to deliver on his campaign promises to improve the standard of living of ordinary Uruguayans. Indeed, workers across the country staged a general strike early in August to demand wage hikes and increases in government spending. The strike, which may have included up to a million participants (including civil servants, teachers, and workers in the banking sector and in hospitals), demonstrated the strength of the unions in the small country of under 3.5mn people.

Given the scale of the protests and the importance of a politically expedient response, we expect that the government will accommodate these demands. If inflation rises into double-digits, expenditures will likely rise even more significantly, as this automatically triggers an additional renegotiation of public sector wages. Meanwhile, the weak peso has also affected the government's expenditures, as currency depreciation has largely offset the collapse in oil prices as measured in US dollars. Despite Brent crude falling to around just USD40.00/bbl at the time of writing, the government increased regulated fuel prices by 7.0% in July to help offset rising costs."

Slower growth in China and rising market volatility have boosted the risks to the global economy, the International Monetary Fund warned ahead of the G20 meeting. It cited a mix of potential dangers such as depreciating emerging market currencies and tumbling commodity prices.

Finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of 20 leading economies were pressing for more on China's plans to tackle its slowdown, delegates at the meeting in Ankara said. Emerging market economies are concerned that a U.S. rate hike on top of the Chinese turmoil would pile on extra pressure, they said.

""The focus is going to be on how to deal with the instability and how to get growth going again,"" Canadian Finance Minister Joe Oliver told Reuters.

But the G20 is unlikely to come up with any concrete new measures designed to address the spillover from the instability in the world's second-largest economy, or to call directly on Beijing to address structural issues such as rising bad debts.

Nor is it likely to pressure the Fed to delay its expected rate hikes, despite unease in some emerging markets that such moves could cause capital outflows and currency volatility.

""We cannot live all the time on easy money,"" Luxembourg Finance Minister Pierre Gramegna, whose country holds the rotating presidency of the European Union, told Reuters.

""This G20 comes at a very good time because it gives the Fed an opportunity to gauge all the elements at stake,"" he said. ""One has to be realistic that at one point in time the curve of interest rates will have to change.""

A push by emerging market countries to characterise possible rate hikes in developed nations as a serious risk for the global economy was rejected by drafters of the G20 communique, a source from the Russian delegation said.

""Some emerging market countries wanted to fix a position,"" the source told reporters, when asked whether the Fed's expected rate hike would be mentioned in the communique.

""In one of the wild formulations it said that this was the biggest threat to the world economy. This was killed immediately and forever,"" the source said, but added the text would mention monetary policy changes without referring to specific countries.

Another G20 source said the wording would probably not go beyond a general caution to central banks to bear in mind the consequences of policy shifts.

""There will be no open demand to the Fed to act,"" the source told Reuters.

One concrete move being examined at the Ankara meetings is a proposal from a group of financial stability experts to adopt a two-stage approach for introducing Total Loss Absorption Capacity (TLAC) buffers for big banks, a G20 source said.

The buffer is a new layer of debt big banks like Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Deutsche Bank AG DBGKn.DE must issue to write down in a crisis and bolster their capital situation.

The proposal, on which a final decision is unlikely before a G20 summit in November, would see the introduction of a buffer of 16 percent of a bank's risk-weighted assets from 2019 and 20 percent from 2022, the source said.

The United States had pushed for 20 percent, while some in Europe had been arguing for 16 percent on the grounds that their banks were still recapitalizing after the financial crisis.

Delegates said the G20 was not expected to pronounce on China's desire to have its yuan currency included in the IMF's Special Drawing Rights basket of currencies, but the issue was discussed in the corridors.

""China has moved in the direction in currency and monetary policy ... that is necessary if they want to achieve the goal of getting China into the IMF currency basket,"" German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told reporters, welcoming Beijing's near 2 percent yuan devaluation last month.

China is keen for the symbolic boost it would get from the yuan's inclusion.

Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann said he is open to discussion on including the yuan in the IMF basket, and said recent financial turmoil in China should not pose a lasting danger to the global economy.

""The currency basket should in principle reflect relative global economic strengths,"" he told Reuters, but added China must fulfil the conditions for inclusion.

Gramegna also said the EU would welcome the inclusion of the yuan in the IMF basket, if Beijing meets certain conditions.

""It is a fact that the renminbi has become a reserve currency in many ways ... so it is in the interest of the SDR, and the IMF, and the world, that this important currency finds its way into the SDR,"" he said.

One delegate said it was possible that the likely failure of the U.S. Congress to approve an IMF quota reform that would give China and other emerging markets more say could well work in Beijing's favour on the SDR issue.

The reasoning goes that benefiting the leading emerging country, China, could help offset the perennial failure to boost emerging market quotas.

However, IMF members will also be examining whether China's heavy intervention in the yuan market was befitting of a freely convertible reserve currency, the delegate said.

One option being floated was the idea of giving China a more limited share of the SDR basket at first until its convertibility and market orientation improved."
210,"NEW YORK (Kitco News) - Gold prices continue to be anchored by the U.S. dollar and the imminent Federal Reserve rate hikes, however, one CEO says the metal is gearing itself up for higher prices.

According to Peter Schiff, CEO of Euro Pacific Capital, the U.S. central bank does not actually want to raise interest rates, as markets perceive.

'I don't think they're really considering it,' Schiff said in an interview with Kitco News Tuesday afternoon.

'I think they know that if they raise rates, everything is going to collapse and they're going to have to cut rates back to zero and look like complete fools,' he added.

Schiff also noted that the Fed's best strategy right now would be to just let markets take their course and face the crisis the Fed 'interrupted' a few years back with its easing measures. He added that market perceptions may be the reason behind this rate hike drama.

'They never actually committed to [raising rates], it's just the markets that have made that assumption,' he said. 'The Fed has not gone out of its way to correct that assumption, but I think that's by design.'

The Euro Pacific chief also commented on gold, noting that the metal is set up for higher prices.

'I think when people realize that there is no [rate] lift off from the Fed, that's when the gold rocket ship will really take off,"" he said. ""I think it's going to be spectacular.""

2015,"They allegedly cheated investors by accessing data related to lapsed policies

Five men were arrested for their alleged involvement in separate instances of financial fraud, the police said.

In the first case, two men identified as Ajay Kumar and Vikas Verma were arrested in Rani Bagh for impersonating as representatives of a prominent finance company and cheating a businessman on the pretext of providing a loan.

On August 30, the police said, the duo’s latest victim filed a criminal complaint alleging that he had been promised a loan of six lakh rupees in the process of which he had been cheated.

“The complainant was cheated first by being asked to pay Rs.3,100 as file charge and, after 20 days, of Rs.30,000 in cash following which the accused disappeared with his money which had been extracted in lieu of providing him a loan,” said a senior police officer adding that the accused duo was arrested the next day on the basis of a specific tip-off and had admitted of having cheated at least 30 other unsuspecting loan seekers.

In a separate case, three men were arrested for duping unsuspecting investors by promising them high returns on financial investments in central Delhi.

Identified as Amit Khanna, Akshay Sharma and Bhupender Sharma, the accused were arrested while investigating a three-year-old complaint alleging that the trio had cheated a resident of central Delhi of over three lakh rupees.

The complainant was told that if she purchased four to five policies being offered by various companies, she would start getting handsome returns after five months and even be able to pay the annual premium for the said policies.

According to the police, the complainant had purchased five policies worth Rs.3,20700 between 2012 and 2013 but no profit accrued after five months of purchase.

“When she did not get any profit from the insurance companies, she did not pay the renewal premium and these policies lapsed.

“Again some agents started calling her to get her policies revived. In hope of reviving the same and inducement of getting refund of Rs.5-8 lakh, she was duped of Rs.2,44,250 on various occasions on the pretext of service tax, service charge, processing fee among others,” said an officer.

She realised that she was being cheated and therefore she contacted beat officers, whose contact numbers were on “Beat Visiting cards” “MAY I HELP YOU” recently distributed door to door for immediate help.

The beat officer informed the local police station where he was posted and a trap was laid at the complainant’s residence where one of the agents who had contacted her over the phone, was lured on the pretext of collecting the cheques required.

“Khanna was arrested as soon as he paid the complainant a visit and later led us to the rest of his associates. During interrogation, they have confessed of having cheated several investors by fraudulently accessing data related to lapsed policies and inducing them to make bogus investments to revive them,” the officer added.

The complainant was told that if she purchased four to five policies being offered by various companies, she would start getting handsome returns after five months"

866,"Oil prices inched higher on Thursday in see-saw trade, tracking gains in Wall Street equities for a second consecutive day despite a weekly build in U.S. crude inventories that weighed on the outlook for oil.

Reprising Wednesday’s volatility, crude oil futures rallied more than $2 (U.S.) a barrel, then retreated. Global benchmark Brent slipped into negative territory before edging up to settle modestly higher.

“Early strength and a late fade,” Donald Morton, an oil trader with Fairfield, Connecticut-based Herbert J. Sims & Co., said, describing the action.

Brent’s front-month contract, settled up 18 cents at $50.68 a barrel. At one point during the session it had risen above $52.

U.S. crude’s front-month gained 50 cents, settling at $46.75. It went above $48 earlier.

The market staged an early rally on Wall Street, then sputtered on caution over a U.S. jobs report due on Friday that will probably influence the Federal Reserve’s decision on a potential interest-rate hike.

Adding to early support for oil was the European Central Bank’s pledge to keep monetary policy after weak inflation and growth forecasts.

In China, markets closed for public holidays for the rest of the week, lending calm to oil and other assets battered by last month’s tumble in Chinese equities.

Oil prices remained under pressure though, from Wednesday’s U.S. government data showing crude stocks swelling 4.7 million barrels in the latest week, the biggest weekly rise since April.

On Friday, the market will also watch the U.S. oil rig count for direction. The rig count has risen for six consecutive weeks so far, and any drop could bolster oil’s price outlook. Oil prices have been a wild ride over the past two weeks. U.S. crude plunged to a 6-1/2-year low of $37.75 early last week, then climbed almost 28 per cent over three trading sessions into Monday. It has since retraced much of that three-day gain.

Traders and analysts braced for more volatility ahead.

“Oil is technically exhausted after being whipsawed violently over the past few weeks,” said Chris Jarvis, analyst at Caprock Risk Management in Frederick, Maryland.

“Bulls have little to hang their hat on and shorts have just been taken to the cleaners. Both bears and bulls have gone to their respective corners for a breather.”"
70,"Sept 2 (Reuters) - A Philadelphia investment advisory firm has agreed to pay $21.5 million to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil charges that it fraudulently retained fees belonging to collateralized debt obligation clients.

The SEC on Wednesday said Taberna Capital Management kept over $15 million in fees in connection with restructuring transactions even though the money rightfully belonged to the CDO clients.

The retention, which occurred from 2009 to 2012, was neither disclosed nor permitted by the CDOs' governing documents and created undisclosed conflicts of interests, the SEC said.

""Taberna secretly diverted funds owed to CDO clients, and concealed that diversion and the conflicts it created,"" Michael Osnato, chief of the SEC enforcement division's complex financial instruments unit, said in a statement.

Taberna, a subsidiary of RAIT Financial Trust, agreed to pay a $6.5 million penalty, $13 million of disgorged profit, $2 million interest, and accept a three-year ban from being an investment adviser.

RAIT, a real estate investment trust, previously disclosed reaching a settlement with the SEC in September and recorded it during the third quarter of 2014.

""As previously disclosed, this settlement with the SEC deals with the legacy Taberna business which we exited in December 2014,"" RAIT Chief Executive Scott Schaeffer said in a statement.

Two former officials, managing director Michael Fralin and chief operating officer Raphael Licht, settled related charges for $100,000 and $75,000, respectively.

Fralin agreed to be barred from the securities industry for at least five years, while Licht is barred for at least two years. Neither they nor Taberna admitted nor denied wrongdoing.

Mary Hansen, Licht's lawyer, said he was ""very happy to have this behind him and move forward."" A lawyer for Fralin did not respond to a request for comment."
544,"The U.S. economy grew faster than initially thought in the second quarter on solid domestic demand, showing fairly strong momentum that could still allow the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates this year.

Gross domestic product expanded at a 3.7 percent annual pace instead of the 2.3 percent rate reported last month, the Commerce Department said on Thursday in its second GDP estimate.

The GDP report, which was released in the wake of a global stock market sell-off, should offer assurance to both investors and cautious Fed officials that the United States was in good shape to weather the growing strains in the world economy.

Concerns over slowing economic growth in China sent global equity markets into a tailspin last week, raising doubts that the U.S. central bank would raise its short-term interest rate next month.

On Wednesday, New York Fed President William Dudley said that prospects of a September lift-off in the central bank's key lending rate ""seems less compelling to me than it was a few weeks ago.""

The upward revisions to second-quarter growth also reflected the accumulation of $121.1 billion worth of inventories, up from the previous estimate of $110 billion. That meant inventories contributed 0.22 percentage point to GDP instead of subtracting 0.08 percentage point as reported last month.

While the huge inventory build will likely weigh on growth in the third quarter, the blow could be softened by rebounding business investment on capital goods.

Economists polled by Reuters had expected that second-quarter GDP growth would be revised to a 3.2 percent rate.

Underscoring the economy's solid fundamentals, a measure of private domestic demand, which excludes trade, inventories and government expenditures, increased at a 3.3 percent rate, instead of the previously reported 2.5 percent pace.

Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, grew at a 3.1 percent rate, rather than the 2.9 percent pace reported last month. Consumer spending got off a to brisk start in the third quarter, with retail sales rising solidly in July.

A strong labor market, cheaper gasoline and relatively higher house prices, which are boosting household wealth, are helping to support consumer spending."
1423,"CALGARY – The number of half-empty office buildings in Alberta is projected to spike, as Colliers International predicts an “ill-timed” building boom should push up vacancy rates in Calgary and Edmonton.

In a report released Tuesday, the real-estate brokerage’s chief economist Andrew Nelson said, “the fall in oil prices has had a negative impact on the energy-reliant markets (in Western Canada),” which has contributed to rising vacancy rates and falling rental prices in Alberta’s two largest cities.

Vacancy rates jumped over the course of the second quarter. In Calgary’s case, Colliers reported the downtown vacancy rate rose to 13 per cent from 10 per cent, while Edmonton’s vacancy rate increased to 11.2 per cent from 10.6 per cent.

A glut of new buildings under construction in both cities could push those numbers up even higher.

“Canada is also in the midst of an ill-timed supply surge that caused vacancy rates to rise even in markets with positive absorption in (the second quarter),” the report noted.

There are 5.2 million square feet of office space under construction in Calgary right now, which is the largest amount of new commercial space being built in any city in Canada and could further push up vacancy rates.

Edmonton, a city with a current total of 17 million square feet of office space, is in the middle of its own building boom with over 2 million square feet of space under construction.

Some observers see at least a partial silver lining in the numbers.

In recent years, Calgary Chamber of Commerce director of policy and research Justin Smith said, commercial real estate costs downtown Calgary were “going through the roof” and “accelerating at a pace far beyond the Canadian average.”

He said those escalating costs made it difficult for some companies to stay in downtown Calgary and noted that even large companies like Imperial Oil Ltd. and CP Rail Ltd. moved their head offices to the suburbs.

The uptick in vacancy rates, he said, could provide some relief to smaller companies looking to do business downtown, as rental rates are projected to fall as vacancies rise.

However, the numbers in Calgary may understate how much office space is sitting empty as a result of a phenomenon called ghost vacancies, where companies that have cut staff hold onto more office space than they need.

Colliers executive vice-president and partner Jim Rea said that ghost vacancies mean that, even if employment levels rise, vacancy rates may hold steady.

“The ghost space may never come to market, but those companies that currently have excess capacity of office space, as they continue to staff up, you can’t assume that they’ll be back in the market looking for more space,” Rea said.

Weakening demand for office space in both Calgary and Edmonton has resulted in large quantities of commercial real estate coming back on the market this year.

The report showed that 1.7 million square feet of office space has become available in Calgary’s downtown core, thanks in part to thousands of layoffs in the oil patch and a decline in the need for commercial space.

That is the largest quantity of newly empty space in any downtown in North America, including Houston, an oil and gas town where 1.6 million square feet have become available this year.

Edmonton posted positive absorption numbers in the second quarter, but is still down over the course of the year. So far this year, 8,400 square feet of downtown office space has gone on the market in the city this year."
890,"BrewDog and its “Equity for Punks” crowdfunding offer is now listed on Crowdcube in a “first” combined debt and equity capital raise.  The offer is marketed as the “Worlds Biggest [funding] Round”. According to Crowdcube, investors may purchase 2 shares of BrewDog stock for £95 or purchase a bond for £500 with a fixed 6.5% annual rate of return.  Both offers have been married with perks like discounts on beer.

This is not the first time BrewDog has offered equity online and the company is, in fact, a trailblazer in the equity crowdfunding space.  Started out of the back of a van by two guys and dog,  BrewDog has had an epic journey going from zero to becoming the largest independent brewer in Scotland.  The craft brewer is now recognized globally for its high-quality product and today employs over 350 people, exports beer to over 50 countries and operates over 32 branded bars with more to come.  Operating profits came in at £3.9 million in 2014. BrewDog announced it was raising capital directly online this past April.  The 4th Equity for Punks target raise is for a solid £25 million.  The offer quickly raised £5 million within the first 20 days but since then funding has slowed.  According to BrewDog funding now stands at around £8 million.

The new capital will be used to build a bigger brewery – something that will create 130 permanent jobs. Additionally BrewDog is looking to expand its international presence including its first brewery located outside of Scotland.  BrewDog recently announced it had acquired land in Ohio in the US for this purpose.

After BrewDog announced its offer in this past spring there was a bit of glitch as the company acknowledged there were errors in its documentation and was now not considered a “UKLA Approved Investment”. Some equity crowdfunding industry people were of the opinion that offers should only take place on FCA registered portals.  The UKCFA referenced the BrewDog offer in a statement this past May;

“The UK Crowdfunding Association exists to support and promote crowdfunding, which includes giving businesses the opportunity to use platforms to source finance from their fans, friends and other investors. However, we believe that this should be conducted by FCA-authorised crowdfunding platforms, which are subject to uniform standards of disclosure, transparency and treating customers fairly. Investors can then be assured they are receiving clear and correct information that has been approved by the platform, and that the appropriateness of the investment has been considered. We will be engaging with the FCA in this regard, but in the meantime urge investors to consider the regulatory status of a platform before making an investment.”

With the offer now being hosted by Crowdcube these questions should not be laid to rest.

All Street, a research entity that follows equity crowdfunding offers in the UK, published an opinion on the offer and associated valuation.  Business Insider UK said at the time that All Street’s statement “destroys BrewDog’s ‘punk’ stock offering”.  A closer review of the All Street statement indicated it was not quite so definitive.  Adding a bond offer, with a fixed rate of return, should assist in the funding round.  James Watt, BrewDog co-founder commented on the All Street statement;

Today BrewDog has over 30,000 individual investors, most small retail types who are also ardent brand ambassadors. In many ways, BrewDog is a perfect example of using the internet to marry fans, ownership and advocacy for a consumer-facing product. BrewDog is continuing “its plans for world domination” as it asks the public to help fund the expansion of its brewery in “Scotland and bars all over the planet”.

1935,"After serving jail time for a Ponzi scheme, a New York man became a self-help guru and contrived a new scam to repay the victims of his first crime, according to the SEC.

Eric J. Aronson and his two cohorts have to repay millions in ill-gotten gains for operating the massive Ponzi scheme, for which he also faces criminal charges, the SEC announced Wednesday.

Aronson, of New York City, was ordered by a federal judge, ruling on lawsuit brought by the SEC last week, to disgorge $18.2 million and pay a penalty of nearly $1.4 million for his part in a Ponzi scheme that raised more than $26 million from investors. In addition to using the money to fund a lavish lifestyle of gambling trips, luxury cars and jewelry, part of the money from this scheme was used to make court-ordered restitution payments to victims of a previous financial scheme to which Aronson pled guilty in 2000, serving over three years in prison, according to the SEC.

After he was let out of prison, Aronson became a self-help guru and published a book, ""Dash,"" that supposedly teaches people how to make the most of their lives. Aronson also created Dash Systems LLC, a motivational and coaching company. He appreared on CNN, Fox, NBC, CBS and ABC as a motivational coach. According to a New York Times profile on him, Aronson said he was transformed in prison and decided to focus on helping people after he was released.

The most recent penalties were imposed by U.S. District Court Judge Jed S. Rakoff in the Southern District of New York on August 24. Along with the penalties for Aronson, Vincent Buonauro, his partner, must pay $12.6 million in disgorgement and a $10,000 civil penalty, and Fredric Aaron, his former lawyer, must pay $1.8 million in disgorgement and a civil penalty of $250,000.

The second Ponzi scheme, carried out between 2006 and 2010, involved the sale of promissory notes and “use of funds” agreements with more than 140 investors, who thought they were investing in PermaPave Industries, a group of companies that produced water permeable paving stones imported from Australia, according to the SEC. Investors were promised returns of 33 percent.

The three partners told investors there was a tremendous demand for the product and that they would be repaid from the profits generated by guaranteed product sales. In reality, there was little demand for the product, and defendants used investors' money for themselves and to make payments to earlier investors, the SEC says."

601,"More than 2,100 miles east of Hollywood and almost 900 miles south of New York City, the state of Georgia is fast becoming a major player in the TV and film industry.

With the help of an inventive tax credit, the state's TV and film industry has boomed. Since the tax credit went into effect in 2008, the industry's economic impact has jumped from $260 million to an estimated $6 billion this year, Georgia estimates. The state now ranks third in production, behind California and New York, according to the Motion Picture Association of America. Business shows no signs of slowing, but the rapid growth has brought on some pretty stiff labor pains.

""What we've experienced is, we don't have enough crew to support all of the features and television series that are coming in,"" said Lee Thomas, deputy commissioner of the Georgia Film, Music and Digital Entertainment Office."
907,"U.S. public-university endowments, including the country’s second-wealthiest at the University of Texas, are reporting fiscal 2015 returns that fail to meet the annual industry standard.

University of Texas Investment Management Co., with $26.6 billion in endowment assets, said it had a weighted 3.5 percent average return for its two funds for the year ended June 30, Chief Executive Officer Bruce Zimmerman said in an e-mail. The Austin-based company invests funds for Texas A&M University and the University of Texas.

Ohio State University, University of Florida Investment Co. and Indiana University Foundation all have reported this month that returns for the period were less than 5 percent. Endowments aim to achieve about a 7.5 percent return to protect against inflation and provide for university support expenses.

“Although most endowments and foundations benefited from double-digit returns in 2014, the outlook for future returns is more muted,” Monica Issar, global head of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s endowment and foundation group, said in a research paper published this month. Funds will have to move away from passive investing strategies, she said.

The median return for large endowments and foundations this year is 3.6 percent, according to Wilshire Trust Universe Comparison Service. Weak U.S. equity and bond markets plagued investors. For the year ending June 30, a benchmark 60/40 portfolio of the MSCI World Index and Barclays Global Aggregate Index returned 1.6 percent.

“Those returns are not acceptable relative to target returns,” said John Keshner, managing director of endowments and foundations at Northern Trust Asset Management in Chicago, which oversees $946 billion of investments. He said heavy exposure to global equities, particularly in emerging markets, weighed down most endowments.

Ohio State, the sixth-wealthiest public college, with assets of $3.6 billion, said it returned 3.8 percent. The school had more than 40 percent of its portfolio in equities during the period, which dragged down exceptional returns from venture capital and real estate.

John Lane, who’s been the university’s chief investment officer since October, said alternative investments have boosted the portfolio. The Columbus, Ohio-based fund posted the lowest 10-year return last year among the 100 wealthiest U.S. endowments tracked by Bloomberg.

“Ohio State outperformed our benchmarks for fiscal 2015 in all major asset classes and in a better risk-controlled structure,” Lane said in an e-mail.

The overachiever among endowments that have reported so far this year is the UNC Investment Fund, which posted a 9.3 percent return for 2015. Managed by UNC Management Co., it includes endowed funds from The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and North Carolina State University."
1783,"Commodity prices just slumped to their lowest level since the end of the 20th century, according to a widely used Bloomberg index.

The index is made up of 22 major traded commodities and has been sliding recently, but the chaos in Asian markets hit prices particularly hard on Monday.

Commodity prices hit their post-crisis peak in early 2011 and have generally been sliding since then — they're now all the way to where they were in 1999, before the 2000s commodities boom began.

There's a mixture of good news and bad news explaining why the prices are plunging. Part of the story is a surge in supply, for example in oil. The world's major producers have made a concerted effort to slow the advance of American oil production by increasing the supply and therefore reducing the price. That's good news (so long as you don't own any oil rigs).

The bad news reason is that part of the explanation is falling demand, and the falling expectation of future demand, particularly from China. That'll also reduce prices, since exporters expect fewer buyers for their products."

MADISON, Wis. (AP) - The first television ad designed to bolster Republican Scott Walker's sagging presidential campaign highlights his 2011 struggle with public sector unions, the clash that made him known across the country.

The 60-second ad by the super PAC Unintimidated begins broadcasting in Iowa on Tuesday as part of a $7 million buy that runs until the Feb. 1 caucuses. It is part of more than $16 million the group backing Walker plans to spend in the next six months for ads in South Carolina, New Hampshire, Nevada and other states. The group released the ad online Thursday in advance of its broadcast.

Titled ""Fight & Win,"" it comes as Walker is taking a more aggressive approach and trying to regain ground lost since early polls placed him in the top tier of GOP rivals.

It begins with dramatic footage of screaming protesters who converged on Wisconsin's capital in 2011, when Walker proposed effectively ending collective bargaining for most public workers. His proposal also forced teachers, state employees and other public union members to pay more for health insurance and pension benefits, as part of a plan to plug a roughly $3 billion budget shortfall.

Those protests, which went on for weeks, grew to be as large as 100,000 people. Walker's signing of the law curbing union rights led to the attempt to recall him from office in 2012, which he defeated.

""Time after time Scott Walker fights and wins,"" a narrator says over soaring music and footage of Walker's presidential launch event in the summer.

The ad also highlights some of Walker's accomplishments as governor.

It refers to Wisconsin having a ""billion dollar surplus,"" which was true in January 2014 but not now. Facing a $2 billion shortfall this year, Walker pushed through deep spending cuts, including a $250 million reduction to the University of Wisconsin. The state actually ended the 2015 budget year, in June, with a surplus of $71 million, according to latest estimates.

The ad points out that Walker signed $2 billion in tax cuts into law during his first term. Those tax cuts contributed to turning the $1 billion surplus into a potential shortfall in less than a year.

The ad also refers to the state's unemployment rate dropping from 7.8 percent the month before he took office to 4.6 percent in June. It doesn't mention that Walker didn't come close to his signature 2010 campaign promise, repeated in the 2012 recall election, that the state would add 250,000 private sector jobs by the end of 2014. Only 129,000 jobs were added.

Wisconsin's private sector job growth during Walker's first term was 5.7 percent, compared with 9.3 percent growth nationwide.

2494,"Is It Normal for a Building to Have a Financial Statement That Isn't Audited?

Aug. 13, 2015 — Why would a building have a financial statement that is not audited? Should we be concerned?

An annual financial statement reports on your building's financial condition and cash flow. This report is relied on by shareholders or unit-owners, by prospective purchasers, and by lending institutions. Almost all co-op and condo bylaws require an inspection of books of accounts in the form of an annual report. Most require that the annual report be audited and issued by an independent certified public accountant. When the bylaws do not call for the auditor to ""certify,"" the co-op or condo board has the option to have its accountant issue a report that simply compiles or reviews the property's books and records.

It is in the building's best interests to have an independent accounting firm prepare an audited financial statement so that the independent CPA can report that, in his or her opinion, there are no misstatements in the audited report, and that the information is presented fairly and accurately. The CPA cannot make that representation if the report is merely a compilation or review. A certified audit gives the building the greatest level of credibility for both new buyers and lenders, and qualifies the building to receive the most favorable financing options from banks and creditors."
2281,"JOLIET – The family of an Elwood woman has sued an organ donation company they say has not returned her cremated remains.

The family of Kathleen McLaughlin filed a complaint Thursday in Will County court against Schiller Park-based Biological Resource Center of Illinois and affiliated companies, claiming that if McLaughlin’s cremation occurred, the center hasn’t delivered her ashes as agreed.

Attorney Michael Gahan, who is representing the family, said the lawsuit stems from an FBI investigation earlier this year that found Biological Resource Center was selling body parts.

A message on the company’s website indicates it closed July 31, but “will proceed with the burials of cremated remains in our donor memorial garden.”

Before McLaughlin died Nov. 29, she told her children she wanted to donate her lungs for medical research with the hope “scientists could learn something from her condition that might cure or ... ease the suffering of someone else,” Gahan said.

McLaughlin signed consent forms to donate her body, which required the defendant to cremate her remains after scientific study was performed and return the ashes to her daughter, according to the lawsuit.

The lawsuit stated Biological Resource Center staff told the family late last year an urn containing the remains would be delivered within 30 days.

In January, federal agents raided the crematorium to find thousands of body parts and tissue samples allegedly to be sold on the black market, according to media reports.

“We believe [the remains] that were found include Mrs. McLaughlin,” Gahan said.

The lawsuit accuses Biological Resource Center of intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent infliction of emotional distress, wrongful disposition of a body, illegal disposition of remains and two counts of fraud. The lawsuit seeks a minimum of $50,000 in compensation.

“[The family] is looking for closure,” Gahan said. “If there was to be a cremation, it hasn’t taken place, or the ashes need to be returned to the family.”"
772,"Joe Hockey is right. The economic news is hardly wonderful, but the media's attempt this week to convince us the economy was perilously close to recession was sensationalist nonsense.

What set them off was news from the Australian Bureau of Statistics' national accounts that real gross domestic product grew by just 0.2 per cent in the June quarter. What they forgot to mention was that in the previous quarter it had grown by 0.9 per cent.

As Hockey says, the figures ""bounce from quarter to quarter"". But why let that small fact get in the way of a good scare story?

The less excitable Dr Chris Caton, of BT Investment Management, put it another way: ""The weak growth for the June quarter was in part payback for the strong growth in the March quarter.""

Just so. We were told, for example, that spending on home building fell by 1.1 per cent in the latest quarter, but not reminded that the previous quarter it had grown by a remarkable 5.6 per cent. There is no reason to believe the housing construction boom has ended.

We were told that the volume of exports fell by 3.3 per cent in the latest quarter, but not reminded that in the previous quarter it had grown by 3.7 per cent. Turns out the weather was unusually favourable around bulk-commodity ports in the first quarter, but unusually bad in the second.

We weren't told about these one-off negatives for growth in the June quarter, but much was made of a one-off positive: a sudden surge in defence spending, we were told, fully accounted for the quarter's 0.2 per cent growth. (Actually, it was worse than that. Whereas total public sector spending made no contribution to growth in the March quarter, it contributed 0.6 percentage points in the June quarter.)

All this is why searchers after truth rather than headlines don't take quarterly changes in GDP too literally. Combine the two quarters and you get average quarterly growth of 0.55 per cent, or annualised growth of 2.2 per cent - which is probably closer to the truth. Illustration: Glen Le Lievre

It also fits better with a fact we were told only in passing, that the economy grew by 2 per cent over the year to June and by 2.4 per cent on average over the financial year, meaning Treasury's forecast of 2½ per cent was near enough to right - a point Hockey kept making and the media kept ignoring.

Examine the figures for the year to June and you don't find much evidence of an economy likely to collapse in a heap. Consumer spending grew by 2.5 per cent, home building by 10.4 per cent, public sector spending by 3.3 per cent.

Export volumes grew by 4.5 per cent, while import volumes fell by 0.7 per cent. In fact, apart from a small fall in the level of inventories, the only major negative contribution to growth came from business investment spending, which fell by 4.1 per cent.

That fall comes from the end of the mining construction boom, of course. It's a reminder of the truth of our position - that our transition from mining-led growth to more normal sources of growth has been far from smooth and isn't achieved yet - a truth too prosaic for the headline chasers. Growth in the low 2s is clearly well below average.

But if you dig a bit deeper you do find signs that the transition is proceeding, with help from record low interest rates and an ever-lower dollar. For a start, there is evidence of recovery in non-mining investment. According to rough figuring by Kieran Davies, of Barclays bank, it's up by 4 per cent over the year to June, led by investment in the services sector.

Exports of services - including tourism and education - are also growing. Though little changed in the June quarter, their volume was up 7 per cent over the year, Davies says.

""With imports of services down 8 per cent over the past year as the falling exchange rate has made it more expensive to take an overseas holiday, trade in services [exports minus imports] added 0.1 percentage points to GDP in the June quarter and 0.6 percentage points over the past year.""

Much has been made of the 1.2 per cent fall in ""real net national disposable income per person"", rightly described as the best measure of material living standards the national accounts provide. It's fallen for five quarters in a row.

Why? Because of the deterioration in our terms of trade - the prices we receive for our exports relative to the prices we pay for our imports - as coal and iron ore prices have fallen.

But it's important to see this in context. Why do so many people care so much about economic growth? I (and Joe and his boss) think it's mainly because they want to see more jobs created.

If so, real GDP - the quantity of goods and services workers are employed to produce - is a more relevant indicator than the various measures of ""real income"". And the growth in GDP we've had has been sufficient to create 240,000 jobs over the year to July (including 68,000 during the supposedly knackered June quarter) and to stabilise the unemployment rate at just over 6 per cent.

It's true that the size of our real income has an effect on our spending on goods and services, and the demand for goods and services affects employers' demand for workers.

But much of the loss of income caused by lower coal and iron ore prices is borne by the mining companies (which are about 80 per cent foreign owned) and by state and federal governments (which collect lower mining royalties and company tax), rather than by the rest of us.

Times aren't easy, but we're not in bundle-dropping territory."

1598,"Gary’s bobber disappeared under the water, so he set the hook, and a chrome silver salmon thrashed to the surface. He battled the fish for several minutes, then led it to the net, and our first fish of the day was on the boat. We had already fished 5 prime spots without even getting a bite before Gary hooked and landed that first silver. Afterward, at the same hole, each of us managed to land a limit of the prized silver-sided sport fish. That one hole was the only place we were able hook a fish the entire afternoon, but it turned out to be an exceptional early September fishing trip and well worth the effort.

Considering the fishing options available in the Mat-Su Valley during the first week of September, fishing for the area’s most popular sport fish (silver salmon) is my first choice. As far as catching large, fine eating fish, I know of no other opportunity that can compare to what silver salmon fishing offers — even this late in the season. Granted silver salmon numbers in lower river locations have dropped off dramatically since early August, but so has the number of anglers competing to catch the fish. On our trip earlier this week, we saw five groups of anglers out on the water, but were able to fish every hole I wanted to try without competing with anyone. For those wanting uncrowded salmon fishing opportunities, it doesn’t get much better than that.

Of course, all early September salmon fishing trips don’t end with such spectacular catches, and even when one catches good numbers of silver salmon, this time of year, some of the fish are likely to be blushed with darker spawning colors. A higher percentage of better quality salmon tend to be located lower in the drainages. If one is most interested in numbers of fish, upstream locations usually have considerably more fish late in the season.

Remember to check fishing regulations, as some waters closed to bait fishing starting Sept. 1 (Susitna River drainage streams). In addition, most — if not all — Susitna River drainage streams also require single hook artificial lures starting on the same date. These regulations were originally set to reflect the transition between salmon fishing to wild trout fishing that occurs during the month of September. As far as I can tell, the fishing public may be better served if the transition in regulations occurred a bit later — perhaps after the first week of September or starting on Sept. 10. For example, when I talked with Margo Nealis of Phantom Tri River Charters in Talkeetna on Monday she said they were still catching some chrome silver salmon, and one of their guides mentioned they had not been catching any trout, yet, on their salmon charters. The Talkeetna River is starting to drop and clear up with the cooler temperatures we have been experiencing lately and by mid or late September trout fishing will pick up. Right now, most anglers are more likely to catch salmon.

On streams where bait is still legal to use, I bring salmon roe fresh-cured with Pautzke’s Fire Cure. This is my go to silver salmon bait, however, after working a hole with bait, additional silver salmon may be caught by switching to artificial lures. On the trip I described early in this column we caught three of our silver salmon on Flashtrap Spinners. My friend, Ben Allen, catches impressive numbers of late-season silver salmon by twitching large Dahli Lama flies — in addition to using bait. While using different lures and bait may be effect at any time during the season, I often rely on a variety of lures/bait to a higher degree later in the season, when silver salmon are less abundant

Mat-Su locations where I’ve fished for September silver salmon include Susitna River drainage streams, Fish Creek near Knik Goose Bay Road, and Eklutna Tailrace. Other silver salmon hot spots worth trying include Wasilla Creek / Rabbit Slough, Cottonwood Creek, and the Talkeetna River.

Because of low returning silver salmon numbers, the Jim Creek drainage near the Butte was closed to all silver salmon fishing earlier this week by Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G) emergency order.

944,"TOKYO: Popular Japanese messaging app Line said on Friday it was still considering plans for an initial public offering, after a report said it had shelved the sale for the second consecutive year. Line´s owner, South Korean Internet firm Naver, was preparing an IPO for the company in 2014, but reportedly postponed it to focus on the messaging app´s expansion. It was later reported that Line shares could start trading in Japan -- and possibly New York -- as early as this summer in a deal that could value it at more than $8 billion. But the Wall Street Journal on Thursday cited unnamed sources as saying that Line had delayed the plan again until at least next year. Responding to the report, Tokyo-based Line said it was still mulling a sale. ""Our company has never cancelled plans for an IPO -- we´re still in the review process,"" a spokeswoman told AFP. ""As far as the timing is concerned, we will look at the situation with global markets and our firm´s own performance in deciding when to go ahead with a sale."" The 2014 sale plan was put off due to disagreements between Line and its parent company over details of the listing, local media said. More recently, global markets have been hit by a wave of volatility over fears about a slowdown in China and the impact on the world economy. Line, a must-have app for Japanese smartphone owners, lets users make free calls, send instant messages, and post photos or short videos, along with a host of other paid-services. It combines attributes from Facebook, Skype and WhatsApp. But the Wall Street Journal on Thursday cited unnamed sources as saying that Line had delayed the plan again until at least next year. Responding to the report, Tokyo-based Line said it was still mulling a sale. The app has a strong presence in Asian markets such as Thailand, Taiwan and Indonesia, as well as some Spanishspeaking areas, including Spain and Mexico. Line has been looking to expand in bigger markets, such as the US, but has not been able to make significant headway. —AFP"
2066,"In a submission to a Senate inquiry into credit-card interest rates made public yesterday, ANZ said 70 per cent of people either transfer again or clear their balance before a high interest rate kicks in.

News Corp Australia asked ANZ what proportion transferred again and was told the calculation could not be done prior to deadline, but would be before the bank appeared at the inquiry later this month.

The submission said: “In ANZ’s experience, most customers use balance transfers as designed — to reduce interest payments and repay their credit card debt.”

However, in another new submission, Financial Counselling Australia, said: “Balance transfers clearly target people struggling with debt and can leave them worse off”.

Such offers, FCA said, should be limited to people who have managed to people who have shown an ability to clear their debts.

In defending itself, the bank said about half of all credit-card customers do not pay interest. Sixty per cent of ANZ rewards cards customers “do not generally pay interest”. Holders of its “low-rate” 13.49 per cent card were most likely to pay interest, it said.

ANZ sought to further justify its rates by arguing that fraud costs had doubled over the past four years, driven by consumers’ love affair with buying from abroad via the web.

It provided the inquiry with data suggesting credit-card providers collectively lost $300 million in 2014 on “card not present” fraud — which includes online shopping. That was an increase of 42 per cent or $90 million on the year before. Nearly two-thirds of card fraud had international links.

ANZ revealed rewards schemes make up 27 per cent of the expense of providing cards — more than the cost of the actual money lent, according to Commonwealth Bank’s earlier submission. ANZ said funding was 35 per cent of costs. Chasing debts and fraud was 30 per cent.

The Senate inquiry’s hearings resume today in Melbourne. It will not hear from the Big Four today.

Meanwhile, about 25,000 households have joined a campaign seeking a better deal on unsecured credit. The Big Debt Switch began on Monday.

432,"A Wall Street rally ran out of steam, limping to the close of Thursday’s session as oil futures relinquish early gains ahead of highly anticipated Friday employment report.

The jobs report is widely viewed as the last piece of U.S. data puzzle before the Federal Reserve makes its interest-rate policy decision at its two-day meeting beginning Sept. 16.

On Thursday, early investor optimism, sparked by healthy data and comments viewed as dovish from European Central Bank President Mario Draghi faded as stocks took its cues from a retreat in oil futures late in the trading session.

The S&P 500 SPX, -1.34% which rallied more than 1% in early session, closed 2.27 points, or 0.1% higher to 1,951.13, with eight of its 10 main sectors finishing in positive territory.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -1.49%  relinquished its 200-point pop to finish 23.38 points, or 0.1%, higher at 16,374.76, while the Nasdaq Composite COMP, -0.94%  ended the day down 16.48 points, or 0.4% at 4,733.50.

Crude oil CLV5, -1.11% rose as high as $48.42 earlier in the day but the commodities’ retreat below $47 a barrel, weighed on energy stocks.

An earlier move higher in stocks had come as Draghi at a news conference reasserted that the central bank was ready to “fully implement” its asset-buying program, which is scheduled to run until Sept. 16 “or beyond” if necessary. However, he said the committee didn't discuss “increasing the size or pace of purchases.”

While there had been some risk that Draghi wouldn’t take the easing plan to the next level, the news was welcome to investors as a sign that the central banker was committed to driving the economic recovery in Europe, said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott.

“Draghi’s action shows [the ECB is] flexible with what they are willing to do,” Luschini said.

Thursday’s actions comes amid relative quiet in Asian markets with the volatile Chinese closed for China’s World War II victory day parade, providing “much desired respite from the economy and market that has been at the heart of the elevated global volatility of late,” said analysts at Accendo Markets in a note.

Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew said in a CNBC interview aired Thursday morning that he is keeping a “careful eye on market volatility” and looking at any related risk to the U.S. economy.

U.S. data: Wednesday’s private-sector jobs report as well as jobless claims point to an improving labor market and set the tone for Friday’s nonfarm payrolls report.

The number of people who applied for U.S. unemployment benefits rose at the end of August to the highest level in two months, but initial claims are still at very low levels, indicating companies aren’t laying off many workers.

In other data, the U.S. trade deficit fell by 7.4% in July to a seasonally adjusted $41.9 billion, mainly because of lower imports such as cellphones and pharmaceutical products.

The Institute for Supply Management said on Thursday its services index slipped in August but to a very strong reading indicating growth in the sector. The services index fell to 59% in August from 60.3% in July.

Movers and shakers: L Brands Inc. LB, +0.17%  shares climbed 4.1% after the retailer said its August sales rose from the previous year, with same-store sales topping Wall Street forecasts.

Shares of Frontier Communications Corp. FTR, -2.72% jumped 6% after Federal Communications Commission approved its acquisition of Verizon’s Wireline operations In California, Florida And Texas.

Joy Global Inc. JOY, +2.01%  plummeted 15% after the company reported worse-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue as weak demand for commodities continues to batter the mining-equipment maker.

Other markets: Asian markets closed mostly higher, inspiring gains across Europe’s equity benchmarks as well. Markets in Shanghai and Hong Kong were closed for a two-day holiday to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of the World War II.

Gold GCZ5, -0.52%  also dipped, while the dollar DXY, +0.06%  gained against most other major currencies.

2342,"The gap between income and house prices has sky-rocketed so much in the last 20 years that even in the most affordable regions of England and Wales buyers are forced to spend six times their income, a new data analysis reveals.

The situation is most dire in the capital, where the median house now costs 12 times the median London income.



The Guardian analysed 19 million sales over 20 years from Land Registry and HMRC data. It shows how in every region in England and Wales there have been dramatic increases in house prices in proportion to incomes, fuelling concerns that millions will be locked out of the UK property market. 



A homebuyer earning the median salary for their region in 1995 would have had to spend between 3.2 times and 4.4 times their salary on a house, depending on where they lived. In 2012-13, the last year for which complete data is available, the median house price had risen to between 6.1 times and 12.2 times median regional incomes.

In 1995, the median income in London was £19,000 and the median house price was £83,000, meaning that people were spending 4.4 times their income on buying a property. But by 2012-13, the median income in London had increased to £24,600 and the median house price in the capital had increased to £300,000, meaning people were forced to spend 12.2 times their income on a house.



Even in more affordable regions, prices have risen dramatically. In the north-east, the most affordable region in England and Wales, the proportion of income spent on property has almost doubled in 20 years, increasing from 3.4 times the median income of the region in 1995 to 6.1 times the median income in 2012.

Fionnuala Earley, residential research director at estate agents Hamptons International, said: “House prices have completely outstripped income growth.

“The biggest factor is that in the run-up to the crash, interest rates were low, so you could afford to service a bigger mortgage then. There was also low inflation on essentials like food, fuel, transport and utilities, so people had more money in their pockets and were able to gear up for bigger mortgages.”

Duncan Stott, director of affordable housing campaign group PricedOut, said these figures indicated that the gap between the “housing haves and the housing have-nots” was getting ever wider.

“It’s not just that every region has got more expensive, but how much more expensive some regions have got. When you look at places where housing prices are increasing, places like Cambridge, Reading, Bristol, Oxford, these are places where jobs are being created but they’re completely unaffordable, so there’s a huge mismatch between the labour market and the housing market.”

After London, the most expensive regions for property are the south-east and south-west of the country, where houses cost 9.9 and 9.2 times the median incomes of those regions respectively. This is followed by the east of England (8.8 times median income), the West Midlands (7.3 times), the east Midlands (6.9 times), Wales (6.8 times), and Yorkshire and the north-west (each 6.6 times).

The most expensive postcode district to buy property in 2014 was Mayfair in London. Twenty-six properties were sold in that postcode district in 2014; the median house price was £2.9m, the most expensive property sold in the area to an individual cost £18.4m and the cheapest went for £155,100.

London accounted for the 36 most expensive postcode districts in the country, with Leatherhead in Surrey the 37th. In Leatherhead, the median house price in 2014 was £775,000 and the most expensive property sold that year went for £2.9m.

The postcode district where houses were cheapest was central Bradford in West Yorkshire where there were 191 sales in 2014. The median house price in BD1 was £40,000, with the cheapest property selling for £29,000. After Bradford, the most affordable districts were Ferndale in the Rhondda Valley, followed by Grimsby in Lincolnshire, New Tredegar in Caerphilly, and Middlesbrough.

The most expensive house sold to an individual in 2014 was in London and went for £50m, while the cheapest was a £7,000 property in north-east England.

The gap between house prices and income have led the OECD to class the UK in the category of countries “where houses appear overvalued but prices are rising”. The OECD warns that economies in this category, which also include Canada, Australia and New Zealand, are vulnerable to the risk of price corrections.

Stott warned that rising house prices meant more people would be perpetual renters, which would have untold effects on society. “It takes a toll on young people who can’t afford a house. A lot of us are going to be spending our lives renting and we need to be thinking about the implications for children growing up in private rentals and how on earth we pay the rent when we retire, which no one is talking about.

“It’s an unsustainable setup we’ve got, if we don’t deal with problems now – the lack of supply, lack of mortgage controls and lack of property tax reform – we’re going to sleepwalk into these problems,” he said."
2229,"Court documents filed in Lincoln County District Court outline how Plaintiffs Ryan Sellers and Donna Tryon are suing the City of North Platte, Assistant Fire Chief Trent Kleinow, and Dr James Smith who, according to the lawsuit, is the Medical Director for the Fire Department.

It all has to do with a new ambulance company called Priority Medical Transport Smith and Kleinow are co-owners of and, received a $350,000 loan from tax payer money also known as money from the Quality Growth Fund.

""Well as a taxpayer the process we go through to do this needs to be more transparent obviously there is a potential for a huge conflict of interest because these are two people that work for the city getting this loan personally. There is a great interest for a conflict of interest and we need some,"" said Plaintiff Ryan Sellers.

Priority Medical Transport LLC applied for a $500,000 grant from the Quality Growth Funds at the beginning of July.

The application was first heard by the North Platte Quality Growth Fund Citizens Review Committee, but the lawsuit says adequate public notice was not before that meeting.

The lawsuit claims the open meetings law was violated.

Sellers says there needs to be more over-site when it comes to the quality growth fund.

""Well at first we need to stop this loan to get it nullified and then we need to change the process of the quality growth fund itself,"" said Sellers.

The Defendant's attorney did not want to comment at this time because he says they just received the lawsuit in the mail today (Wednesday)."
1231,"A deal between Charter Communications and Time Warner Cable is just one example of companies taking advantage of the country's currently accommodative merger conditions.

A perfect storm of economic and business conditions has set the stage for what could be a record year for mergers and acquisitions in the U.S.

A study released last month by corporate news and analysis firm Mergermarket found the overall value of mergers and acquisitions in the first half of 2015 climbed to $1.7 trillion, up 11.6 percent over the same period a year before and ""marking the highest half-year period since [2007].""

""Confident management teams and shareholders in 2015 continue to rally M&A totals,"" the report said. ""Shareholders are not only encouraging, they are expecting companies to use bold M&A for growth in 2015.""

To that point, consider the news in the last eight days alone: General Electric is likely to receive a green light from the European Union to buy French energy and transportation firm Alstom for $14 billion, Liberty Interactive Corp. is snatching up online retail site Zulily for $2.4 billion and Berkshire Hathaway has unveiled its planned $32 billion acquisition of Precision Castparts Corp. 

 

And all those price tags are fractions of the $46 billion Kraft-Heinz Co. merger or the $55 billion Time Warner Cable-Charter Communications contract – both of which have already made headlines this year.

The Mergermarket study found that 28 deals in the first half of the year eclipsed the $10 billion mark for a combined total of $678.1 billion in merger and acquisition activity. That value is 87.2 percent higher than deals totaling more than $10 billion that were closed in the first half of 2014.

""It's been six years since the depths of the financial crisis, and we finally are at a place where boards and managements are comfortable again – confident again – about taking the risks of mergers,"" Gary Parr, vice chairman of financial advisory and asset management firm Lazard, said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" last week. ""The stock market is still rewarding mergers, by and large, even for the buyers.""

Megadeals and major acquisitions have occasionally sparked sell-offs in the past, but the market appears to be treating buyers more favorably during this cycle. GE's stock, for example, climbed nearly 2 percent Friday, when Reuters cited unnamed sources suggesting the European Union was likely to approve the company's pending bid for Alstom. GE's market gains were confined mostly to afternoon trading, following Reuters' midday story.

Liberty Interactive, the principal company behind home-shopping network QVC, saw stocks gain about 2 percent Tuesday shortly after markets opened, following the firm's Monday announcement of its planned Zulily deal. And Berkshire Hathaway stocks gained more than 1 percent when the company announced its planned acquisition of Precision Castparts on Aug. 10.

""Shareholders are very accepting of M&A. This year alone, two-thirds of the stocks of the buyers have gone up as a result of M&A. Usually there's pressure on the buyers' stock, but it's very different now,"" Michael Carr, co-head of Goldman Sachs' mergers and acquisitions group, said last week on CNBC's ""Closing Bell."" ""Shareholders seem to be really, really receptive.""

This year's M&A uptick is far from a random occurrence; business conditions in the U.S. right now are particularly accommodative for consolidation. For one, it's become increasingly common in recent years for American firms to hoard hefty cash reserves, which can help finance mergers. Nonfinancial U.S. firms rated by Moody's Analytics – including Apple, Microsoft, Google, Pfizer and Cisco – held a total of $1.73 trillion in excess cash at the end of 2014, up 4 percent year over year.

This excess cash can also be used to reward loyal investors through dividend payments and stock buybacks. A recent S&P Capital IQ analysis found that Standard & Poor's 500 companies funneled a median 36 percent of their cash flow from operations into dividend payments to investors and stock buybacks in 2013 – up from just 18 percent in 2003.

That trend shows no sign of slowing down in 2015. A recent Goldman Sachs study estimates U.S. companies will reward investors with more than $1 trillion in 2015, with buybacks jumping 18 percent and dividends ticking up 7 percent year over year.

But some are skeptical that buybacks, in particular, are a good use of excess cash. Mergers have been cited as a more strategic use of funds.

""We recognize activist investors often advocate for firms to return excess cash to shareholders via buybacks. … But in our view it is a questionable use of cash at the current time,"" David Kostin, chief U.S. equity strategist at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a research note earlier this year. ""In our view, acquisitions – particularly in the form of stock deals – represent a more compelling strategic use of cash than buybacks given the current stretched valuation of U.S. equities.""

Borrowing money to make a deal also is particularly affordable right now, given the country's near-zero interest rates. Rates have been depressed for years, but a potential liftoff date in September and subsequent upticks throughout the next several months could be contributing to the recent surge in merger and acquisition activity.

""We're late in the credit cycle. The interest rate cycle will probably shift in the next six months to a year. This is a big flurry of M&A activity being pulled forward,"" says James Camp, managing director of fixed income at Eagle Asset Management.

Camp also notes the American economy's relative sluggishness in the first half of the year, with second-quarter corporate earnings being particularly disappointing. In the absence of economic growth, Camp says many firms are seizing this opportunity to expand through acquisition rather than output.

""It reeks of just low prospects and poor growth. It's not to say we're recessionary or we're not better than most places,"" Camp says. ""But it does appear that corporate CFOs and CEOs are more than content for balance sheet engineering at the expense of organic growth or long-term investment.""

Firms could potentially use excess cash to invest in new equipment or facilities for their employees, which would inherently help boost productivity and could generate more organic growth and higher wages.

But companies appear to be reluctant to invest in their own workforce, as private nonresidential investment in the second quarter – meaning firms' spending on facilities, equipment and intellectual property products – dipped 0.6 percent for the first quarterly contraction since 2012.

Without such investments, productivity is unlikely to tick up, which means workers' wages aren't likely to surge anytime soon, either.

""When you have corporations that are paid to deploy shareholder capital in productive ways, and they find that the best use of that capital is to buy back stock or do acquisition strategies, it does not seem like it's a robust environment for investment and [research and development] – those things that are ultimately wealth-creative and job-creative,"" Camp says. ""This is a late-cycle financial engineering phenomenon that doesn't give us a lot of comfort that major, robust job creation or wage growth or inflation is on the horizon.""

 MIAMI, USA -- Francisco Illarramendi, the Venezuelan businessman whose unlicensed hedge funds turned into a $723 million Ponzi scheme, for which he was sentenced to 13 years in federal prison, is seeking to be released on bond. He alleges that, while confined in a correctional facility, he cannot adequately review the government's 800 documents that prove the losses of his victims. 

 

 The US Attorney's Office opposes his motion, asserting that it is merely a ploy to be released while his appeal, which most observers would probably judge is without any merit, is pending.

 

 Illarramendi's pre-trial conduct resulted in his bond being revoked by the court in 2013, for valid reasons, and he stalled his sentencing for four years, while he changed lawyers, and alleged that he could not ascertain the precise amount of victim loss. If released pending his appeal, he could instruct his counsel to delay the proceedings, for months, or even years. 

 

 He is also a flight risk, with knowledge of the methods used to secrete funds in Caribbean tax havens, where he sent bribes. He may have funds available to him in the offshore financial centres where he moved money.

 

 This Ponzi schemer took out $25 million for himself to provide a lavish lifestyle, while covering up a huge loss in his hedge fund for years.

755,"India’s economy has long labored in the shadow of its great Asian rival, but now officials in New Delhi and private economists say Beijing’s recent stumbles could provide a big opportunity for India to close the gap.

While China’s stock markets have tanked amid mounting reports of slowing growth, India is poised to steal the mantle as the world’s fastest-growing major economy while sidestepping many of the problems that face other emerging economies as China cools.

“I see this as a great opportunity,” Indian Finance Minister Arun Jaitley told the BBC last week as global markets reeled from the bad news and volatility coming from China.

“The Chinese ‘normal’ has now changed. It is no longer the 9 percent, 10 percent, 11 percent growth rate,” Mr. Jaitley said. “So the world needs other engines to carry the growth process, and in a slowdown environment in the world, an economy which can grow at 8 to 9 percent like India certainly has viable shoulders to provide the support to the global economy.”

Bikky Khosla, writing on the Indian business web publication SME Times, said there was a growing feeling in the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi that “China’s loss is going to be India’s gain.” India’s population is younger and soon will be bigger than China‘s. Debt levels are low, falling oil prices are a boon for the energy-importing Indian economy, and there is room for massive productivity growth given the country’s huge infrastructure needs and the movement of hundreds of millions of Indians from poverty to the middle class.

“I strongly believe that we are today in better shape compared to China,” Mr. Khosla wrote. “The Chinese economy is slowing, but India is gathering pace.”

Analysts have been predicting that the Indian tortoise would soon outpace the Chinese hare for decades, only to be regularly proven wrong. Despite its seeming advantages — democratic rule, a well-established legal system, a large percentage of the population that speak English — India has lagged behind as China became the world’s manufacturing superstar and newest economic superpower.

China’s gross domestic product and per capita income are both more than twice that of India, while the percentage of those living below the official poverty line is 6.1 percent in China compared to nearly 30 percent in India. Foreign direct investment — the key indicator of global market commitment — was just $35 billion for India last year, according to the U.N., compared to $128 billion — No. 1 in the world — for China.

Mr. Modi, elected in May 2014 largely on the hopes he could jump-start the economy, has struggled to implement his ambitious reform program. His plans to overhaul land acquisition laws and the country’s notoriously Byzantine tax code have been blocked this year, and his “Make in India” program has made little apparent headway in changing the image of India’s stifling, business-unfriendly bureaucracy.

Ashoka Mody, an international economics professor at Princeton’s Woodrow Wilson School and a former deputy director at the International Monetary Fund, cautioned against the notion that India would automatically profit from China’s woes.

“The illusion that India actually benefits from the recent turmoil — because, for example, oil prices are low — ignores the fact that prices are low because the global economy is so weak,” Mr. Mody wrote in a blog post for the Brussels-based economic think tank Bruegel this week.

“The pervasive global weakness ultimately does the greater harm, especially because India is not competitive,” he added. ” … China has been the linchpin of the global economy for a decade. If China goes into a swoon, so will India.”

But the mood is far more optimistic these days among top Indian officials, who cite a number of factors working in their favor.

While resource-rich rivals such as Russia, Mexico and Brazil have been slammed by falling oil and commodity prices, India’s economy is far less reliant on such exports. The Indian economy essentially matched China with 7 percent annualized growth in the second quarter of 2015, and the IMF now projects that India will grow faster than China for all of 2015 and for 2016 as well."
2059,"There’s a very real chance you could fall victim to defamation, identity theft or even blackmail. Lachlan Jarvis, managing director of private investigation firm Lyonswood, explains what you need to know.

THERE are two main types of risks posed to people whose details are listed on the Ashley Madison data dump. The first risk could be categorised as reputational, that is, the prospect that a person’s social standing could suffer harm. The second type of risk is the danger that the person will suffer real loss, whether it be in the form of damage to finances, property or credit histories.

Dealing with the first risk is perhaps more straightforward than people might suspect. As some writers have pointed out online, just because your details are listed does not mean you signed up, used or even had knowledge of the Ashley Madison account. And it certainly doesn’t mean you cheated on your partner.

Verification of email accounts was not required so any email address could be used with any name to create a user account. Stolen credit cards are readily available online and, given the site’s lax security, who knows what level of credit card owner verification was employed. With a little bit of homework, it’s not necessarily difficult to build a profile of a person and use that person’s identity as a dating site persona for example.

As private investigators, we are often asked to obtain evidence that a person is engaged in infidelity. There is only one form of proof that is ultimately going to result in peace of mind and that is video evidence of the suspect partner meeting and showing affection towards another person.

SMS or Facebook messages may raise some questions about a person’s behaviour but that’s all they will do because they’re entirely subject to contextual interpretation. We tell our clients that confronting cheating partners — who won’t tell the truth — with anything less than actual proof will actually leave you in a worse position. This is because the cheater will simply deny your accusations and ensure they are far more careful when they cheat next time.

The Ashley Madison information is in a similar category. At best, it’s tenuous evidence. If it’s used as the source of online or emailed defamatory statements about you, you should feel comfortable that you can rightly say that the leaked data is NOT evidence of any wrongdoing on your part and the onus is not on you to prove anything.

I don’t purport to offer expert relationship advice so professional help should be sought where required to deal with difficulties arising in an intimate relationship as a result of the data breach.

What is perhaps more concerning than reputational damage is the fact that people who have their details listed on the Ashley Madison database are faced with problems they may not anticipate.

Firstly, there is the risk of blackmail. Someone who takes a moralistic view of infidelity might seek to engage in such practices. We worked on a Supreme Court matter in 2013 where our client was blackmailed anonymously by a person who discovered he was having an affair so it can certainly happen.

Secondly, you could be subject to hacking attempts through the email account you have listed. There are already scams documented online whereby scammers are targeting those listed on Ashley Madison with malware.

Thirdly, and in my view the most concerning thing, is the risk of identity theft. If you have used Ashley Madison or if someone has used your details on the site, you might be vulnerable because your key details are now all in one place and accessible. An opportunistic identity fraudster might take this opportunity to set up bank accounts or register companies under your name. This is where your credit history can suffer.

If you are listed in the hacked information, to manage the above risks some basic strategies should be employed.

You should take down as much other online information about yourself as possible. Time to deactivate your social media accounts and ask your employer to remove your profile from the company website where possible. Do a detailed Google search and determine what additional details a blackmailer or identity thief could uncover about you. Do your best to get that content down.

Someone wanting to blackmail you, defame you or steal your identity will be looking for as many details as possible so as to build a profile they can use. Relationships you have will be useful as they can threaten to pass on details about your alleged infidelity to your friends, family and work colleagues if those persons can be identified.

Contact your bank and discuss with them what has happened. If you used your own credit card to access Ashley Madison, ensure it is deactivated. You should discuss with your bank ways in which the information that is now in the public domain could be used to set up accounts in your name and ways you can minimise the risk of this happening. If the bank’s advice is that you are vulnerable, you should consider contacting other financial institutions and advising them that you do not intend to open accounts with them in the near future.

Likewise, contact ASIC and advise them you do not intend to register a company in the near future.

Periodically do Google searches under your name to determine whether your details are being used in any improper manner. For example, if someone sets up a Facebook account using your details then you should contact Facebook and get it taken down immediately.

Be very careful with any email account listed on the data dump. If you still access this email account, ensure you are not opening emails that could be phishing scams or contain malware.

If a blackmail or identity fraud attempt is made, you will need to report this to the police. The police have limited resources so you may need help from the private sector to endeavour to identify the culprit. We were successful in identifying an online blackmailer in the Supreme Court and assisting our client to recover money in this infidelity blackmail matter so there are in some circumstances options available to victims."

1488,"Natural-gas futures continued to trade lower Thursday after the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that supplies of natural gas rose by 69 billion cubic feet for the week ended August 21. Analysts polled by Platts forecast a climb of between 58 billion cubic feet and 62 billion cubic feet. Total stocks now stand at 3.099 trillion cubic feet, up 480 billion cubic feet from a year ago and 88 billion cubic feet above the five-year average, the government said. September natural gas ngu15 was at $2.67 per million British thermal units, down 2.3 cents, or 0.9%. The contract, which is set to expire, traded around that same level before the supply data.

Read the full story: Oil rebounds to trade back above $40 a barrel"
1513,"Last Monday, when all hell was breaking loose in markets around the world and crude oil plunged to the lowest level in over six and a half years at $37.75 per barrel, natural gas really tried to follow. The price got down to $2.641 per mmbtu and no one would have been surprised if it traded below support on the weekly chart at $2.4430, the April 2015 continuous contract lows. Support on the active month NYMEX October futures contract at $2.6380 even held, and the energy commodity stayed within the trading range. By Friday, as oil recovered in violent fashion to close a volatile week almost 20% higher than the lows on Monday, natural gas quietly closed at $2.724 per mmbtu. I have prepared a video on my website Commodix, which augments this article and provides a more in-depth, detailed analysis on the current state of the natural gas market to illustrate and highlight the real value implications and opportunities available. In addition, I am launching my new service on Commodix today, Monday, August 31.

My favorite episodes of ""Seinfeld"" are the ones with Izzy Mandelbaum, an octogenarian muscle man and trainer. Chants of Mandelbaum, Mandelbaum, Mandelbaum just amuse me. Izzy's favorite saying, before he throws out his back as he attempts to dazzle Jerry with his athletic abilities is, ""It's go time."" Well, it is the end of August and for natural gas, now is go time.

The summer of 2015 is ending. It is back to school time, vacations are over. It will not be long before the leaves are falling from the trees and the brisk autumn weather turns to cold and snow across many parts of the United States. When it comes to natural gas, August tends to mark a low point in price. In 12 of the last 15 years, natural gas prices moved higher in September and October than the lows of August, the dog days of summer. The low for the October NYMEX natural gas futures contract this August was $2.641 per mmbtu. (click to enlarge) The daily chart of the October NYMEX contract highlights the lackluster trading activity over recent months. Prices have remained in tight trading range between $2.641 and under $2.99 since the middle of June, and speculative activity has been on the decline. Open interest, the total number of open long and short positions on NYMEX natural gas futures contracts, has dropped from over 1,050,000 at the end of June to 919,964 last Friday, a decrease of over 12%. With an 80% history of higher prices from August into the fall season, natural gas is now screaming ""It's go time!""

The entire world watched and commented as the price of crude oil began its descent from over $107 per barrel in June of 2014. However, another energy commodity, natural gas, beat oil to the punch. (click to enlarge) Four months before oil began its fall, natural gas shook off frigid temperatures during February 2014 and began its descent from highs of almost $6.50 per mmbtu. As the weekly chart illustrates, since then, natural gas has plunged by over 58%. Crude oil is now exactly 58% below its June 2014 highs of $107.73 per barrel. The current technical condition of the natural gas market is neutral, but there are a few factors worth noting. The decline in open interest means fewer players are in the market these days. Natural gas below $3 is historically cheap. Momentum and relative strength are at neutral levels. The thing that sticks out to me like a sore thumb is weekly historical volatility. Natural gas is combustible and so is its price. At under 20% weekly historical vol, this commodity is just too quiet. Over history, natural gas has been known to trade to levels of over 100% volatility, so today's readings indicate a market that is asleep. Natural gas has spent the summer of 2015 hibernating; history tells us that it is likely to awake from its slumber soon. It's go time for natural gas.

Coal has been an important energy commodity in the United States throughout history. The production of power, or electricity, long depended on coal fired cogeneration plants. Coal was king, but that is changing. The U.S. administration has put new rules and regulations in place that sign the death warrant for coal as the energy used to produce electricity. The replacement, the new king, will be clean burning natural gas. There is an abundance of natural gas in the U.S. Huge reserves in the Marcellus and Utica shales contain over a quadrillion cubic feet of the energy commodity. However, the number of rig counts has dropped precipitously over the past year and the replacement of coal is a new demand vertical for natural gas. Another new demand area is liquefied gas. Cheniere Energy (NYSEMKT:LNG) will be shipping liquefied natural gas around the world from their terminals in Louisiana, yet another new demand channel for the forlorn commodity. At a price of under $3 for natural gas, fundamentals seem to be saying, it's go time.

Everyone has been bearish on everything that is energy related for a long time now. The big supplies of natural gas in the crust of the earth depend on companies with the financial wherewithal to extract it. Lower energy prices across the board have caused huge strains on energy producers. The drop in oil prices has been the result, in many ways, of huge U.S. production in recent years, and now at current prices, a lot of oil production in the nation is not economic. At under $3 per mmbtu, it is questionable whether natural gas production is a big money maker for energy producers these days. 



Lower energy prices weigh heavily on many debt-laden producers who are likely to produce less given economic strains on their balance sheets and the current levels of price. Additionally, rig counts that are far below last year's levels and one can make a case that although there are big reserves of natural gas, production is uneconomic and the low oil price has stressed many companies that produce both oil and gas. Just look at the share prices of some of the big gas producers. Chesapeake (NYSE:CHK) is trading at $7.39 a share, down from 52-week highs of $27.15, last month they suspended their dividend. Apache (NYSE:APA) is at $44.86 down from 52-week highs at $102. Linn Energy (NASDAQ:LINE) (NASDAQ:LNCO) is at $3.30 down from $31.80. The list of suffering oil and gas companies is long and growing.

All the bearish news for natural gas is currently in the price. It will take very little to ignite volatility in this combustible commodity. The downside is limited and upside explosive. As summer turns to fall, it's go time for natural gas.

We have not witnessed real volatility in natural gas since the winter of 2014. Since then, the price has done nothing but make lower highs and lower lows. The price hibernation during the summer of 2015 has resulted in a period of consolidation and very cheap prices. All signs tell me that natural gas is going to surprise everyone really soon. 



Whether the surprise comes in early or late fall or even in the coming winter, today's low price creates an unsustainable position for producers who are facing economic challenges. Classic economics teaches that low prices for a sustained period of time leads to cutbacks in production. Low prices also lead to increased demand. With new demand verticals and producers hanging on by a thread in terms of their financial conditions, this market is at a critical point. It's go time for natural gas.

2002,"Federal regulators allege two Massachusetts men were part of a $15 million scam that preyed on Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking investors — a case with echoes of the TelexFree Ponzi scheme.

Seven men, including one from Malden and one from Revere, are accused of defrauding more than 1,400 investors worldwide with a series of increasingly fabulous claims about gold mining investments offered by their company, DFRF Enterprises. The group, led by Florida resident Daniel Fernandes Rojo Filho, was also the subject of a class-action lawsuit in Middlesex County about its alleged scheme earlier this year.

“Virtually all of the defendants’ public statements about DFRF have been materially false and misleading,” the SEC said in its civil complaint, which was unsealed Thursday. “There are no gold mines. There is no credit line. There is no charity work. There is no stock registration. There is no insurance.”

Judge Patti B. Saris of the US District Court for Massachusetts issued an emergency restraining order June 30 to prevent the accused from destroying evidence or soliciting money.

The alleged scheme began in June 2014 and accelerated this year after the group began “flooding” YouTube with videos encouraging people to invest, according to the SEC. The agency alleged DFRF took in $10.9 million from March through May.

The operation grew through claims of 10 percent monthly returns, promises that some profits were donated to third-world charities, and commission payments for recruiting new investors, the SEC alleged.

Yet Filho and the codefendants allegedly paid out only $1.6 million to investors and spent much of the money on themselves, the SEC said. Filho is alleged to have siphoned more than $6 million from DFRF, including $1.8 million in cash, $500,000 for travel, and $2.5 million to acquire a Rolls- Royce, two Lamborghinis, two Ferraris, two Cadillacs, and a Mercedes.

Wanderley M. Dalman of Revere and Gaspar C. Jesus of Malden were also charged in the case. Each received more than $50,000 in payments from DFRF over the past year, according to the SEC’s complaint. The agency said both made false statements about the company in online videos.

Neither man had a working phone number listed, and the federal docket did not specify an attorney for any of the accused.

DFRF, Filho, and an attorney for the company did not immediately respond to an e-mail or phone calls seeking comment. An unverified Twitter account that appeared to be affiliated with the company said Filho was conferring with lawyers and would make a statement this week.

The SEC allegations come just over a year after the collapse of TelexFree, a Marlborough company that declared bankruptcy after taking in about $1 billion from 1.9 million participants. TelexFree, which had previously been shut down in Brazil, charged people to sign up and paid them for posting ads online for an online phone service, even though the ads generated virtually no sales. The company’s founders were charged with criminal fraud shortly after the scheme collapsed.

Like TelexFree, authorities say DFRF thrived online. A YouTube channel that posts Spanish and Portuguese DFRF videos has racked up more than 130,000 views. A Twitter profile purporting to represent the company has more than 35,000 followers, and it has tweeted more than 100,000 times. In response to a Globe reporter’s request for comment, it tweeted a link to a video that claimed to show the company was legitimate, but it showed only that it was a registered corporation in Massachusetts.

In February, after two men sued the company in Middlesex Superior Court for taking around $180,000 from them, Filho told the MetroWest Daily News that he ran a successful gold mining company and that he was not orchestrating a Ponzi scheme. He said the men who sued him might have confused his business with TelexFree. He said he had no ties to TelexFree.

Yet the SEC accused Filho of paying more than $310,000 to one of TelexFree’s top salesmen. The commission’s complaint said Filho made several payments to Sanderley Rodrigues de Vasconcelos, a TelexFree agent who is currently under home confinement in Florida after being charged in May for fraud and misuse of visas, permits, and other documents.

The Middlesex lawsuit has been settled, according to the plaintiffs’ attorney, Evans Carter, who did not disclose the terms. But Filho’s name has surfaced in several other lawsuits. In 2010, authorities sought to confiscate nine vehicles, hundreds of gold bars, and more than $10 million held in dozens of accounts, according to media reports and court filings. And the SEC said he assented to the forfeiture of more than $25 million in 2013."
596,"While all eyes are usually on the payroll increase in the monthly jobs report, noted Wharton School finance professor Jeremy Siegel said the unemployment rate is what investors should watch for in Friday's report.

That's because it's ""very critical"" to the Federal Reserve's decision on whether to raise interest rates, he said Thursday in an interview with CNBC's ""Closing Bell.""

Most Fed officials believe an unemployment rate in the 5.0 to 5.2 range is consistent with full employment.

""If we see 5.1 tomorrow morning I think the odds of a Fed increase in two weeks goes way up,"" said Siegel.

Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, told CNBC on Wednesday after the ADP jobs report was released that the unemployment number will almost certainly be going to 5.2 and may go to 5.1. Siegel believes Zandi is one of the best forecasters."
73,"It's finally here. The week that we've waited months and months for. College football begins tonight, and doesn't let up until Monday. For the second straight year, I will pick the winners in every game involving SEC teams. Last year I correctly picked winners almost 80% of the time, so here we go for 2015!

 

 (Thursday) North Carolina @ South Carolina: Steve Spurrier always loves to play on Thursday night. I imagine it's because he can be on the golf course on Saturdays while everyone else is playing football. This could be a tough opener for the Gamecocks, but the ""Ol' ball coach"" always does his best work when his teams are not supposed to be outstanding.

 South Carolina 31 North Carolina 24.

(Thursday) Western Kentucky @ Vanderbilt: This one is rated as a toss-up, even though most people think the Hilltoppers will win. Western was 8-5 a year ago and a good solid football team. Vandy has finally proven the Commodores are past the James Franklin influence.Western Kentucky 28 Vanderbilt  24.Alabama vs Wisconsin at Texas Stadium: I would assume that head coach Nick Saban and offensive coordinator Lane Kiffen have decided on a starting quarterback by now. Crimson Tide fans shouldn't worry much. No matter who they put in will be solid. That's just the way Saban coaches. Last year Blake Sims was a pleasant surprise, becoming a real star in his fifth-year senior season. Alabama is very high on running back Kenyan Drake who really needs to have a big game against the Badgers. Wisconsin will run the ball.....a lot. 'Bama wins but it could be close.Alabama 28 Wisconsin 17.Louisville @ Auburn: Coach Bobby Petrino returns to the plains where he had some success a few years back. He won't be welcomed with open arms by the Tiger fans, but he probably doesn't expect a warm homecoming. He brings a respectable team into Auburn, but Coach Gus Malzahn's squad is just too good.Auburn 45 Louisville 20.New Mexico State @ Florida: The Jim McElwain era begins in the swamp and if the new coach has any success at all on the recruiting trails the Gators will be better quickly. McElwain must find some playmakers in time for the 2015 season however. The good news is the Gators first two games are against New Mexico State and East Carolina.Florida 44 New Mexico State 14.Louisiana-Monroe @ Georgia: It will be hot and steamy in Athens on Saturday as the Bulldogs open the 2015 season with a noon kickoff. Look for an awful lot of Nick Chubb in this one. Coach Mark Richt will likely play things a bit close to the vest, as Georgia has a pair of SEC games against Vanderbilt and South Carolina coming up.Georgia 52 Louisiana Monroe 17.Louisiana-Lafayette @ Kentucky: This is the portion of the schedule the Wildcats excel in; the first part. Coach Mark Stoops cannot allow his team to lose six straight games to end a season as he did last year. It's hard to believe the same Kentucky team that lost in three overtimes at Florida is the same team that lost to Tennessee 50-16. This one goes to the Cats.Kentucky 34 Louisiana-Lafayette 14.McNeese State @ LSU: Night time games on Saturday nights in Baton Rouge are always fun and sometimes magical. LSU could be a real dark horse in the SEC West in 2015 and an easy opener gives the Tigers a chance to settle in with some personnel before playing at Mississippi State next week.LSU 49 McNeese State 20.U.T. Martin @ Ole Miss: The Rebels are another quality SEC team that will break in a new quarterback in 2015. Chad Kelly replaces Bo Wallace for Ole Miss and should be more than solid. It gets a lot tougher in two weeks as the Johnny Rebs play at Alabama. This week should be easy.Ole Miss 40 U.T. Martin 7.Mississippi State @ Southern Miss: This one could be interesting, though the Bulldogs are a 23 point pick to win on the road. MSU was ranked number one in the country last year for five straight weeks and they return a lot of talent, including the SEC's best quarterback in Dak Prescott. The Bulldogs have a lot to prove, mainly that the great season they enjoyed last year was no fluke.Mississippi State 37 Southern Miss 14.SE Missouri @ Missouri: The two time defending SEC East champs will be good again in 2015, but will they be good enough to outlast Tennessee and Georgia who are both picked ahead of them in the preseason polls? That remains to be seen, but there is no doubt the Tigers are better than SE Missouri.Missouri 37 SE Missouri 6.Arizona State @ Texas A&M:   This could be the best game of the day involving SEC teams. The Aggies are picked to win by three points at home against the Sun Devils, but there is the unknown ""Chavis factor"" for ASU to deal with. How much better will Texas A&M be with the ""Chief"" directing the defense? They will be better and they will be good enough to score a win over ASU.Texas A&M 35 Arizona State 24.UTEP @ Arkansas: The Hogs were the one team that nobody wanted to face near the end of the 2014 season, and I'm sure nobody wants to play them this year either. The Razorbacks could be a real sleeper in the SEC West this year and they will have no trouble getting past UTEP.Arkansas 48 UTEP 21.Bowling Green vs Tennessee in Nashville: It's finally ""Football Tine in Tennessee."" Vol fans have waited patiently for months; some even years to see a Volunteer squad this talented take the field. I picked team 119 for Tennessee to win ten games this season, and even though Bowling Green is the pre-season favorite to win the Mid-American Conference title, Coach Butch Jones' squad will prevail. This one will be close most of the way however, as Tennessee fans need to know this is not ""Cupcake U."" Betting odds have been close all summer long. The Vols pass a big test early.Tennessee 38 Bowling Green 27.

NEW YORK (AP) - Dozens of 9/11 rescue and recovery workers gathered at the World Trade Center site on Thursday to demand that Congress extend programs offering money and free health care to people exposed to toxic dust after the terror attacks.

Since 2011, federal programs have offered substantial aid to people with illnesses potentially linked to the tons of pulverized concrete and glass released into the air when the twin towers collapsed.

Tens of thousands of police officers, firefighters, construction workers and others have gotten monitoring exams and free treatment for a wide variety of ailments through the World Trade Center Health Program. Several thousand have applied for payments from a $2.78 billion compensation fund.

Both of those programs are set to expire next year. Advocates for the sick say there won't be enough money in the compensation fund to pay every ill worker. And they say the health programs are essential for people with complicated, often incurable illnesses.

Congress initially limited the programs because of concerns about their massive cost.

The former ground zero workers and 9/11 survivors were joined Thursday by U.S. Reps. Carolyn Maloney, Jerrold Nadler, Peter King, Charles Rangel and Eliot Engel, all of New York, and U.S. Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey. They have supported a bill that could make billions of additional dollars available to people with illnesses possibly linked to the attacks.

""It's not enough to praise their heroism,"" Maloney said.

679,"In Republican circles, this poses a bit of a problem. President Obama and his agenda are supposed to be causing an economic nightmare of historic proportions, with “job creators” crying over their balance sheets when they’re not being dragged into the streets for their ritual tar-and-feathering. With job creation improving so much, so quickly, conservatives find themselves looking for new ways to talk about the issue.

“We have a real unemployment rate that’s probably 21%. It’s not 6. It’s not 5.2 and 5.5. Our real unemployment rate – in fact, I saw a chart the other day, our real unemployment – because you have ninety million people that aren’t working. Ninety-three million to be exact. If you start adding it up, our real unemployment rate is 42%.”

Note, over the course of a few seconds, Trump said the “real unemployment rate” doubled from 21% to 42%. That escalated quickly.

We’re left with two very different sets of numbers. The Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Labor Department have official data that shows a rate of 5.3%. On the other hand, Donald Trump “saw a chart the other day” and came up with 42%.

Trump’s numbers aren’t completely made up. When the GOP candidate talks about “our real unemployment rate,” he points to the 93 million Americans who, in reality, do not have a job.

[M]any people without jobs are teenagers and retirees…. The Labor Department doesn’t consider these people unemployed for a reason: Your kid brother who is a high school junior and my grandma who just turned 88? They’re not considered unemployed, for a very good and very obvious reason!

Right. For Donald Trump, the “real” unemployment rate should include kids in high school and seniors who’ve retired from the work force. That strikes me as a little silly, but your mileage may vary.

But let’s not play political games with the data, pretending there’s a “real” unemployment rate that should include octogenarians."

He said during the inspection officials noticed unusual objects in boxes being transported.

“Amongst various malachite artefacts, officials discovered a sealed container which contained different types of rough stones. On further inspection the following precious stones were found: 143.35g of suspected gold; 63.54g of suspected black diamonds; 67.58g of suspected diamonds; 173.10g of suspected uncut industrial diamonds; 10.36g of suspected clear uncut diamonds; and 566.87g of suspected industrial diamonds,” he said.

1567,"Silver prices today (Thursday) saw a minor retreat as U.S. markets remained mostly flat throughout the day.

At 2:10 p.m., silver prices today were down 0.05% and trading at $14.66. The precious metal is coming off an extremely volatile month, hitting a 2015 low of $14.11 on Aug. 26. Silver prices saw an overall loss of 1.4% in August.

The volatility in silver prices last month was caused by historic sell-offs in stock markets around the world. The Dow Jones Industrial Average cratered 6.6% in August. The index saw the largest one-day plunge in its history on Aug. 24, which the media referred to as ""Black Monday."" China's Shanghai Index dropped 12.5% in August, marking its worst monthly performance in more than three years.

The flat movement in silver prices continues to mirror the broader market. The Dow Jones saw a slight loss of 0.07% this afternoon. Today's quiescence can be attributed to China, whose markets are closed on Thursday and Friday this week.

719,"STEVENS POINT, Wis. (WSAU) -- One of Stevens Point's largest vacant properties in one of it's busiest business districts could be redeveloped soon. The former Cooper Motors lot on Division Street is considered a prime location, right on Business 51-Division Street and only a block away from UW Stevens Point.

Stevens Point Community Development Director Michael Ostrowski says Kraemer Construction of Middleton has approached city leaders about the Cooper Motors property and another property immediately west of the former car dealership. He says the developer would like to build three different things. ""A mixed-use development will consist of a housing component of about 40 units of student housing, as well as a retail restaurant option, both fronting on Division Street, and then potentially another office type use on the back of the property just south of what is currently Klasinski Clinic.""

The proposal calls for a two story office building totalling 20,200 square feet, the 8,000 square foot restaurant, and a four story student apartment building with 55,000 square feet. There is also enough land to exceed the required 212 parking stalls the development would require.

Ostrowski says the preliminary site concept drawings fit what the city wants for Division Street in the long run. ""These buildings start to pull closer to the street, allow for better pedestrian accommodations by school traffic, and it really creates that more walkable area that's one of the focuses we're looking for for the Division Street corridor given the type of uses that are in that area given the two high schools as well as the university campus.""

The proposed development will have it's first public presentation and discussion at the Plan Commission meeting Tuesday, September 8th at 6:00 p.m. at the Lincoln Center."

1612,"The designer who came up with the All Blacks' silver fern has offered to re-draw the iconic symbol seen on three of the four designs short-listed as options for our new national flag.

Dave Clark says the silver fern designs on the Kyle Lockwood and Alofi Kanter's flags needed to ""look more like real silver ferns"".

The offer came after the Herald revealed this morning that the All Blacks had blocked the use of the silver fern which featured on the team's uniforms. The design, which Mr Clark devised in 1986, is trademarked by the NZ Rugby Football Union.

• Wait a minute ... Critics say flags look like political logos, Weetbix

It led to the Flag Consideration Project approaching those who had used the NZRFU fern to ask if they would change their design.

The NZRFU stance came in spite of All Black captain Richie McCaw saying he was keen to see the silver fern on a new national flag.

Four flags have been shortlisted for a public vote - two of those by flag change-advocate Kyle Lockwood feature a version of the silver fern.

While it is not the NZRFU-owned silver fern, Mr Clark - who runs Dave Clark Design Associates - said it could do with a better design.

""A lot of people including Richie McCaw seem to want the silver fern on our national flag. So if we are going to do it, we need to do it right. The three shortlisted flags in question certainly have merit but the ferns need to look more like real silver ferns.""

He said he agreed with the idea of having a silver fern feature on New Zealand's flag. He had also seen it used ""all over the world including as tattoos on many Kiwis"".

Mr Clark said a professional design process would improve the look of the silver ferns put forward in the short-list. He said hundreds of hours went into the All Blacks' trademarked logo. ""The reason the All Black fern works so well is because of the stringent design process I used.""

McCaw said on Monday that he thought the silver fern represented ""what it means to be a Kiwi"". The symbol meant a lot to the All Blacks, so ""something like that probably wouldn't hurt"".

However, a spokeswoman for the Flag Consideration Project said officials met with the NZ Rugby Union to discuss whether it would allow its trademarked fern to be used in designs for a new flag.

The discussion occurred because a number of people had used the fern in their design submissions.

Officials were told permission to use the fern on a new flag was unlikely to be granted. If NZ Rugby Union had allowed its fern to be used on a flag and it made the final four, it would have had to assign all rights in it to the Crown at no cost. Other fern symbols can still be used and feature in three of the final four designs.

After NZ Rugby made it clear it was unlikely to allow its fern to be used, those who used it in their designs were given the option of changing it to remain in contention. About 370 flag designs are still on the flag.govt.nz gallery using the All Blacks silver fern and crediting Clark. None made it to the longlist.

Nick Brown, NZ Rugby's general manager of public affairs, said after initial talks with the flag officials NZ Rugby was not asked to give permission for any flag to progress to the longlist. ""We were comfortable with the guidelines they had in place requiring people to submit original work or obtain the permission of the owner of any designs.""

Hamish Selby, an intellectual property lawyer at Buddle Findlay, said NZ Rugby's decision was understandable and that any public relations benefits in allowing the fern to be used would be short-term.

""It's almost like handing over the crown jewels, so to speak, of their business to someone for no commercial gain,"" Mr Selby said. ""NZ Rugby has a very strong commercial alignment with its fern because the fern is so closely aligned with the All Blacks, and it leverages a lot of its income from the commercial arrangements it has.""

It isn't the only problem the flag project has had with intellectual property issues - it also had to remove all designs which included Hundertwasser Koru after a copyright claim by the Hundertwasser Non-Profit Foundation.

Prime Minister John Key's desire for a new flag was sparked by the 2011 Rugby World Cup - his original preference was for a silver fern on black. Many were surprised it had not made the shortlist, although Kyle Lockwood's version was in the longlist.

The flag panel's chair, John Burrows, said it was considered but the panel decided the white fern on black was too closely associated with sports. ""The silver fern has a long history which goes way beyond just sport. It's been around for hundreds of years, long before commercialisation existed. It has been used on military uniforms, the coat of arms, it's on our money.""

Mr Lockwood referred questions about the intellectual property rights in his two shortlisted designs to the Flag Consideration Project.

A spokeswoman said under the conditions of submitting a flag design, designers who made the final four had to agree to hand over all copyright and intellectual property rights in the designs to the Crown at no cost.

Mr Lockwood sells his flags in a range of designs and colours on his silverfernflag.org website.

Key ""always thought"" the New Zealand Rugby Union would protect its silver fern copyright as he pushed for a change of the national flag.

""It wasn't new news to me,"" he told reporters in Christchurch today.

""People do protect their trademarked symbols, and the Rugby Union has done that for a very long period of time.

""I don't think it matters too much. I know there probably will be endless people who debate exactly what the fern looks like on potentially the new flag. To me the one that Kyle Lockwood's drawn on his and the other flag are perfectly acceptable. They don't all have to be exactly the same. If you showed the average person they would understand what it is and that's good enough.""

One of the designs that made the shortlist of 40 flags was a silver fern on a black background.

But today Mr Key said it wasn't ruled out because of the copyright issue.

The only one ruled out on copyright was a one based on a design by Austrian artist Friedensreich Hundertwasser

• The New Zealand Rugby silver fern was designed by Dave Clark in 1986 and trademarked in 1991 along with the words 'All Blacks'.

• In 2001, NZ Rugby also tried to trademark any version of the silver fern on a black jersey but in 2005 the court rejected its bid.

• During the Rugby World Cup in 2011, NZ Rugby made Giltrap Audi take down a $10,000 'Go the All Blacks' sign, claiming it breached trademark. Instead the company used 'Go the ABs'."

Nevada's 4.8% plunge was the steepest, as construction and tourism industries took a beating. Also hit hard: Wyoming, where incomes fell 3.9%.

Incomes stayed flat in two states and rose in six and the District of Columbia. West Virginia had the best showing with a 2.1% increase. In Maine, Kentucky and Hawaii, increased government benefits, such as unemployment insurance and Social Security, offset drops in earnings and property values.

Nationally, personal income from wages, dividends, rent, retirement plans and government benefits declined 1.7% last year, unadjusted for inflation. One bright spot: As the economy recovered, personal income was up in all 50 states in the fourth quarter compared with the third. Connecticut, again, had the highest per capita income of the 50 states at $54,397 in 2009. Mississippi ranked lowest at $30,103."

662,"According to the latest statistics from our state government, youth unemployment (ages 16 to 19) stands at a shameful 19.9 percent. The current nationwide average unemployment rate for this age bracket is 11.7 percent according to the Department of Labor. Oklahoma is lagging in igniting the careers of young people.

We should applaud Gov. Mary Fallin's attention to this important issue. She has established an aggressive goal to reduce the youth unemployment rate in Oklahoma to 15 percent by 2017. Policymakers can help; business leaders can help even more.

Young people have fewer skills as a result of less experience. This makes them less attractive to hire for most employers. As the minimum wage has steadily increased since it was implemented in 1938 at 25 cents per hour, the demand for hiring unskilled youth has diminished even further.

In 1996, Congress established a youth sub-minimum wage for newly hired employees under age 20 during their first 90 days of employment as an incentive to hire youth workers for internships and part-time employment. This is a pathway to reducing youth unemployment rarely used by the business community —

 primarily a result of lack of knowledge of the policy.

Business leaders can take action to reduce youth unemployment rates in Oklahoma.

Most schools and CareerTech campuses seek members of the business community to help shape the curriculum being taught to students. Business leaders should speak up and help shape the training of the emerging workforce."
916,"Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. filed an S-1 form with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for its initial public offering (IPO). There were no terms given for the filing but the offering is valued up to $86.25 million. The company intends to file on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol ACRS.

The underwriters for the offering are Jefferies, Citigroup, and William Blair.

This is a clinical-stage specialty pharmaceutical company focused on identifying, developing and commercializing innovative and differentiated topical drugs to address significant unmet needs in dermatology. The lead drug candidate, A-101, is a proprietary high-concentration hydrogen peroxide topical solution that we are developing as a prescription treatment for seborrheic keratosis (SK) a common non-malignant skin tumor.

The company has completed three phase 2 clinical trials of A-101 in over 300 patients with SK. In these trials, following one or two applications of A-101, Aclaris observed clinically relevant and statistically significant improvements in clearing SK lesions on the face, trunk and extremities of the body.

Aclaris plans to commence three phase 3 clinical trials of A-101 in patients with SK in the second half of 2015 and, if the results of these trials are favorable, to submit a New Drug Application (NDA) for A-101 for the treatment of SK to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the second half of 2016. The company also intends to develop A-101 as a prescription treatment for common warts and A-102, a proprietary gel dosage form of hydrogen peroxide, as a prescription treatment for SK and common warts. In addition, it intends to in-license or acquire additional drug candidates for other dermatological conditions to build a fully integrated dermatology company.

In the filing Aclaris detailed that it would use the proceeds from the offering to complete its three planned phase 3 clinical trials and seek regulatory approval for A-101, as well as to fund the continued research and development of A-101. The remainder of the proceeds will go to fund other research and development activities, including the development of A-102 for the treatment of SK and common warts, as well as for working capital and other general corporate purposes"

The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell as much a 1.5 percent, its fourth drop in five days. The gauge is on track for its seventh weekly decline, the longest losing stretch since June 2011.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell for a third session following a one-day holiday. The equity benchmark also sank for a seventh week, the worst streak since 2008.

354,"The Romanian Government plans to start talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the other international creditors over a new loan agreement. The biggest political parties support the idea of a new IMF agreement and negotiations could start this year, according to Bloomberg.

However, Romania’s current agreement with the IMF, European Union and World Bank hasn’t been reviewed in over a year, as the international financiers and the Romanian authorities haven’t been able to reach common ground over the fiscal relaxation measures and the salary increases in the public sector.

Romania’s Government went on with the tax cuts, although scaled down compared to the initial proposals, despite opposition from the IMF representatives and from Romania’s National Bank.

Romania may get into a new deal with the International Monetary Fund and the European Union in 2016 to help protect against market shocks, Finance Minister Eugen Teodorovici said on Thursday, in an interview with Bloomberg. He said that Romania didn’t need funding from the IMF and could raise money on its own, but that it was better to have a safeguard against potential market turmoil.

The Social Democratic Party (PSD) and the National Liberal Party (PNL) leaders said they supported the negotiations.

Romania has had three deals with the IMF, EU and World Bank since April 2009. The most recent deal, a EUR 4 billion backstop, reaches its end this month. Romania hasn’t drawn any money from this last loan.

649,"The Colorado Springs unemployment rate fell to a 7½-year low in July largely because of a big decline in the number of people in the job market, which one economist speculated resulted from some young people unable to land jobs because they lack needed skills and others moving to Denver for better jobs.

The 4.9 percent unemployment rate was the lowest since January 2008, down from 5.8 percent in July 2014, according to data released Wednesday by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The 0.3 percentage-point drop from June's 5.2 percent unemployment rate is the largest in 13 months. It ends a nine-month period during which the area's unemployment rate bounced between 5.1 percent and 5.3 percent.

However, the number of people holding or looking for jobs fell for a fourth consecutive month to the lowest level since December 2009 and is down more than 6,600 from a year earlier. Much of the decline in the labor force came in the June and July, when 4,400 people left the job market.

""It's great news that we continue to see a declining unemployment rate. There is no question that we are in better shape economically than we were a year or two ago,"" said Tatiana Bailey, director of the Southern Colorado Economic Forum. ""But the caveat is that the rate of participation in the labor force is declining. That is true across the nation. Some of it is due to baby boomers retiring, but a lot of data also suggest that young people left the labor force in the recession and haven't come back.""

The number of jobs posted with the Pikes Peak Work Force Center has risen in recent months, and half of them are high-paying professional positions. But Bailey said younger workers may be staying out of the job market because they don't have the skills those jobs require. There's no quick fix to that problem, she said, because those workers need training that takes months or years to give them the skills to qualify for many of the center's openings. Bailey said some local young professionals have found more high-paying jobs in Denver.

""Overall, I feel optimistic about the local economy. The trends are moving in the right direction, but we do have an underlying fundamental challenge of how to bring people back to the work force,"" Bailey said. ""The unemployment rate could inch a little lower, but I don't expect it to go as low as the rest of the state, so we will probably stabilize at a level slightly lower than this.""

Dirk Draper, CEO of the Colorado Springs Regional Business Alliance, said Wednesday that the group was ""pleased to see the (unemployment) rate drop to pre-recession levels, but it is a cautionary note that the labor force is dropping at the same time. That points to the importance of training programs such as the welding program at Pikes Peak Community College.""

Payroll job numbers for the Springs showed a dramatic slowing in June and July, but that data comes from a monthly survey of a small number of employers. Quarterly data from the first three months of the year, which comes from unemployment insurance reports filed by most employers, reflects much stronger job growth than the monthly survey data for the same period.

Unemployment rates and labor force totals fell in all of the state's metropolitan areas from June to July, with Boulder reporting Colorado's lowest jobless rate at 3.2 percent and Pueblo reporting the highest at 5.9 percent. Colorado's unemployment rate declined to 4.3 percent in July from 4.4 percent in June."

Former All Black and 100-game Waikato halfback Rhys Duggan, ex-Kiwis rugby league coach Kevin Tamati and national waterpolo representative Brendon Horan are all coaching school teams at the games.  Previous stars like basketballer Dillon Boucher, netballer Tania Dalton and ironman Cameron Brown have also given back to their chosen codes in recent years.

That's something that has Metcalfe excited too, as well as helping her team - which includes her daughter Jorja - enjoy the environment of the competition and the buzz around it.

""A week together is a long time and it's something that's pretty special to be a part of. I'm just really looking forward to seeing how the girls respond to all the things that happen on-court as well as all the cool things that will be happening off the court.""

There are 96 netball teams signed on for this year's tournament, and Metcalfe said she will be happy if they finish higher than any St Peter's team has done before.

Tournament director Vicki Semple said the 12th year of the AIMS Games was going to be the biggest yet, with many top athletes are likely to come from this year's crop.

""Some of our early athletes are already out there as elites, competing on the world stage,"" Semple said. ""We're also seeing former sporting stars line up to coach their local school teams and ensuring that future stars will continue to emerge from all manner of codes."""
1381,"NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Oil stocks have been taking a beating over the past twelve months, but which ones are the biggest losers (and, therefore, cheap to buy)?

While oil prices have been see-sawing over the past week, the trend overall has been down and crude is still at less than half of what it was last summer. Integrated oil companies like Exxon Mobil (XOM - Get Report) have been under pressure, as high prices for what they take out of the ground means more profit from doing so. Oil field services companies like Schlumberger (SLB)  have also taken a hit. Storage and refinery companies have been less pressured.

Perhaps now is the time to be greedy when others are fearful; Warren Buffett, who recently took a large stakein oil refiner Phillips 66 (PSX)  would be proud.

To give you added perspective on whether these stocks are good long-term investments, we've paired them with TheStreet Quant Ratings, TheStreet's proprietary quant-based stock-rating tool. Note; TheStreet Quant Ratings rates many of these stocks ""sell"" or ""hold.""

TheStreet Ratings projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and dividends. Based on 32 major data points, TheStreet Ratings uses a quantitative approach to rating over 4,300 stocks to predict return potential for the next year. The model is both objective, using elements such as volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows, and subjective, including expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings.

Buying an S&P 500 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a buy yielded a 16.56% return in 2014, beating the S&P 500 Total Return Index by 304 basis points. Buying a Russell 2000 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a buy yielded a 9.5% return in 2014, beating the Russell 2000 index, including dividends reinvested, by 460 basis points last year.

246,"CHICAGO, IL, Sep 03, 2015 (Marketwired via COMTEX) -- Methode Electronics, Inc. MEI, -1.37% a global developer of custom engineered and application specific products and solutions, today announced financial results for the Fiscal 2016 first quarter ended August 1, 2015.

Methode's first-quarter Fiscal 2016 net sales decreased $14.8 million, or 6.8 percent, to $203.3 million from $218.1 million in the same quarter of Fiscal 2015. Year over year, currency rate fluctuations decreased net sales by $6.1 million.

Net income increased $2.1 million to $23.5 million, or $0.60 per share, in the first quarter of Fiscal 2016 from $21.4 million, or $0.55 per share, in the same period of Fiscal 2015.

Year over year, Fiscal 2016 first-quarter net income was negatively affected by:

Consolidated gross margins as a percentage of sales improved to 26.4 percent in the Fiscal 2016 first quarter compared to 23.2 percent in the Fiscal 2015 period as a result of favorable currency impact on raw materials and labor costs, favorable commodity pricing of raw materials and manufacturing efficiencies due to increased production at the Company's lower-cost Egyptian manufacturing facility in the Automotive segment, partially offset by costs and inefficiencies due to the transfer of manufacturing from the Philippines to Egypt in the Interface segment.

Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 11.4 percent for the Fiscal 2016 first quarter compared to 10.2 percent in the same period last year. Selling and administrative expenses increased $1.0 million, or 4.5 percent, to $23.2 million in the Fiscal 2016 first quarter compared to $22.2 million in the prior-year first quarter due primarily to higher legal, professional services and travel expenses, partially offset by lower stock award compensation expense.

In the Fiscal 2016 first quarter, income tax expense increased $0.4 million to $7.4 million from $7.0 million in the Fiscal 2015 first quarter. The Company's effective tax rate decreased to 23.9 percent in the Fiscal 2016 first quarter compared to 24.6 percent in the previous first quarter.

Segment Comparisons Comparing the Automotive segment's Fiscal 2016 first quarter to the same period of Fiscal 2015,

Comparing the Interface segment's Fiscal 2016 first quarter to the same period of Fiscal 2015,

Comparing the Power Products segment's Fiscal 2016 first quarter to the same period of Fiscal 2015,

Subsequent Events Methode was awarded a contract from a major North American OEM who currently constitutes a substantial portion of the Company's annual Automotive revenue. This award is for the next generation of an existing program with this customer.

The Company also announced that its board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $100 million of its outstanding common stock through September 1, 2017. Such repurchases may be made on the open market, in private transactions or pursuant to repurchase plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The share repurchase program is subject to market conditions, general business conditions, cash balances, borrowing availability and other relevant factors. The program may be suspended or terminated at any time. No assurance can be given as to the time period over which the shares will be repurchased or as to whether and to what extent the share repurchase will be consummated.

Methode reiterates its Fiscal 2016 guidance of sales in the range of $830 million to $865 million, income from operations in the range of $108 to $119 million and earnings per share in the range of $2.07 to $2.22. The guidance ranges for Fiscal 2016 are based upon management's expectations regarding a variety of factors and involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including the following significant factors considered by management in preparing this guidance:

Management Comments President and Chief Executive Officer Donald W. Duda said, ""First-quarter profitability was positively impacted by favorable currency translation on raw materials and labor costs, favorable commodity pricing and the refund of import duties in our Automotive segment. However, costs and manufacturing inefficiencies in our Interface segment due to the transfer of manufacturing from the Philippines to Egypt and the unfavorable currency effect on sales negatively impacted our results. Looking forward, we are anticipating revenues in our Power Products segment, which is typically one of our highest margin businesses, will be considerably lower than we originally expected for the remainder of this fiscal year, approaching break- even in the second quarter.""

Mr. Duda concluded, ""While we will continue to make investments in our business through new product development, vertical integration and potential acquisitions, we believe the initiation of a share repurchase program demonstrates our continued commitment to creating and returning value to our shareholders.""

1444,"NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Shares of Basic Energy Services  (BAS - Get Report) are increasing by 8.94% to $5.12 in late afternoon trading on Monday, after crude oil hit its biggest three-day percentage gain since 1990 today.

After soaring by 8.8% earlier in the day, crude oil (WTI) is higher by 7.72% to $48.71 per barrel this afternoon, and Brent crude is up by 7.13% to $53.62 per barrel, according to the CNBC.com index.

Oil prices are getting a boost from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' statement today that it will open a dialogue with other producers to discuss oil's fall in prices. So far, OPEC has been unwilling to cut production amid fears of losing its market share despite lower prices, Reuters reports.

Also impacting oil prices is a report by the Energy Information Administration that it lowered its previous estimates for U.S. oil production for the first five months of this year based on new survey methodology.

In a recent Action Alerts PLUS alert, Jim Cramer, Portfolio Manager & Jack Mohr, Director of Research commented on oil. Here is what they had to say:

The EIA's report showed the country pumped 9.3 million bpd in June, down 100,000 from a revised May figure. It said previously reported monthly data for January through May were revised down by between 40,000 and 130,000.



We also learned this morning that OPEC has renewed its openness for dialogue with other producers. We view these two data points positively and would become even more bullish if OPEC finally cooperated and put its words into action.

1510,"Will Rising Electricity Generation and Natural Gas Prices Help Coal? (Part 2 of 9)

Owing to forecasts of warmer weather in the South and partly due to the lower-than-expected addition to the natural gas inventory as discussed in part one of this series, natural gas prices rose during the week ended August 7 after falling for two straight weeks on inventory concerns. The natural gas rig count, which reflects producers’ sentiments, rose by four to 213.

Weather is a driving factor behind natural gas prices, as people use more electricity for cooling on warmer days. Natural gas powers 30% of the overall electricity generation in the US.

Henry Hub benchmark natural gas prices came in at $2.80 per MMBtu (million British thermal unit) on August 7 compared to $2.72 on July 31.

The natural gas front month futures price, which gives you an idea of market expectations for near-term natural gas prices, rose to $2.80 per MMBtu on August 7 compared to $2.77 per MMBtu on July 31.

The shale gas boom led to a massive rise in the production of natural gas, which in turn spurred a drop in natural gas prices. As a result, natural gas became a competing fuel for coal. Cleaner, more competitive natural gas ate away market share from coal in electricity generation, and this trend has continued.

Natural gas prices and coal’s market share in electricity generation are related. When natural gas prices rise, coal gains market share, as it becomes more economical to burn coal for power generation. A fall in natural gas prices generally leads to a fall in coal’s market share because natural gas is available at cheaper rates.

A rise in natural gas prices is positive for coal producers (KOL) like Alliance Resource Partners (ARLP) and Natural Resource Partners (NRP). With a rise in prices, natural gas becomes more important, which makes utilities prefer burning coal over natural gas.

For utilities (XLU) like Dynegy Corporation (DYN) and Edison International (EIX), the impact depends on the level of regulation. For regulated utilities, the impact is generally negligible, as the fuel cost is part of their tariff calculation. For natural gas power plants supplying electricity at fixed price contracts, the increase in natural gas prices is negative, as they spend more on fuel."
254,"Shares of H&R Block Inc. HRB have been trending up since it reported better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter results and announced a capital plan on Sep 1 after the market closed. While shares gained about 8% in the aftermarket trading session on Sep 1, it rallied another 7.5% in yesterday's trading session to close at $35.42. 

 



The Capital PlanWith the successful divestiture of its H&R Block Bank, the tax preparer has chalked up a capital plan that will not only meet its requirements but also enhance shareholders' value. The board of directors approved $3.5 billion worth share repurchases (through Jun 2019) - a new line of credit (replacing the existing $1.5 billion) and incremental debt.Pursuant to the share repurchase plan, H&R Block could launch a ""modified Dutch auction"" tender offer to buy up to $1.5 billion worth common stock and constitute about 16% of its present market value. To that end, the company commenced share repurchases, pricing the shares between $32.25 and $37.00. H&R Block intends to deploy available cash and borrowings under a new credit agreement to fund the transaction.H&R Block also plans to issue new debt to buy back shares. An incremental debt would call for increased leverage. However, the company believes it is well positioned to saddle more debt without affecting the investment grade credit ratings metrics. H&R Block expects to maintain adjusted debt-to-adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) of between 2.5x and 3.0x.H&R Block boasts a track of 211 straight quarters of dividend payment. The board also announced a 20-cent per share dividend. The dividend will be paid on Oct 1 to shareholders of record on Sep 9. The company has paid back $1.4 billion via dividend and share buyback to its shareholders since May 2011. Shares repurchased till now represent 12% of its total shares outstanding.Divestiture of H&R Block BankThe divestment of its bank unit to BofI Federal Bank, a subsidiary of BofI Holding, Inc. BOFI , freed H&R Block from being subject to regulations by the Federal Reserve Bank as a savings and loan holding company. While the divestment will release excess capital, the company will have to incur one-time charges of 2-3 cents in fiscal 2016.

Also, the company expects its bottom line to be hurt by 8-10 cents annually, beginning fiscal-year 2016. Also, H&R Block Bank paid $419 million in cash to BofI Federal Bank representing the carrying value of the liabilities assumed by the later. 

 

 Earnings Review 

 

 Loss from continuing operations of 35 cents per share for fiscal first-quarter 2016, ended Jul 31, was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of loss of 41 cents. The loss was also narrower than 40 cents incurred in the year-ago quarter on discrete tax benefits. Revenues came in at $138 million, up 3% year over year on increased product revenues. However, the negative impact of foreign currency rates was a partial dampener. Revenues outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $136 million. 

 

 Zacks Rank and Other Stocks 

 

 H&R Block presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked consumer service providers are Care.com, Inc. CRCM and Weight Watchers International, Inc. WTW both with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1025,"The Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB) 2015 Survey results released Sept. 2 point to improved environmental performance by the global real estate industry.

Results from the 2015 survey indicated that, in the last year, the global commercial real estate industry achieved a 3.0 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, a 2.9 percent reduction in energy consumption and a 1.7 percent reduction in water use. On-site renewable energy generation rose to 445 gigawatt hours (GWh), a 50 percent increase from the 2014 survey.

The 2015 survey looked at data from 707 listed property companies and private equity real estate funds around the world. In total, the respondents’ portfolios cover approximately 61,000 buildings with an aggregate value of $2.3 trillion.

The assessment included 155 North American participants with a combined gross asset value of $813 billion, including 41 listed property companies and 114 private funds.

North American REITs and private equity funds slightly trailed the global market, with an average GRESB sustainability score of 44 compared to the global average of 46. GRESB noted in the report, though, that North American REITs are making demonstrable improvement.

In 2015, 88 percent of North American entities reported having sustainability policies. A growing portion of these policies include specific provisions addressing climate risk and resilience, or the ability to handle major environmental shocks, according to GRESB.

GRESB also noted that prolonged drought conditions across western North America have highlighted the importance of water conservation and sustainable water supply management. GRESB data shows that 86 percent of North American listed property companies and private funds implemented water efficiency improvements for standing investments within the last four years.

“The global property industry is taking sustainability issues seriously, making them a core part of business strategies. In North America, this is reflected in portfolio-wide efforts to save energy, conserve water and enhance resilience,” said Chris Pyke, chief operating officer at GRESB.

GRESB also recognized a number of U.S. REITs for their exceptional sustainability practices. In the hotel, residential and healthcare sectors, Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (NYSE: HST), Equity Residential (NYSE: EQR) and Ventas, Inc. (NYSE: VTR) were named global sector leaders.

Michael Chang, director of energy and sustainability at Host Hotels, said the company achieved several sustainability milestones in 2014. These included meeting 2017 energy and greenhouse gas targets three years early and investing in more than 100 sustainability projects.

Equity Residential president and CEO David Neithercut stressed that sustainability is a core value: ""Throughout our organization we are committed to making ours a better and more sustainable company for the benefit of our communities, our residents and our shareholders.""

Debra Cafaro, chairman and CEO of Ventas, underscored the importance of sustainability to the healthcare REIT.

“Sustainability is a key value at Ventas and we are delighted to be recognized as the sector leader by GRESB. It reflects the hard work of the Ventas team, which is continuously seeking ways to improve our portfolio, enhance our energy efficiency, reduce our carbon footprint and manage operating costs.  These efforts benefit all of our stakeholder groups - investors, our customers, and the patients and residents they serve, and of course the environment,” she said.

Meanwhile, Kilroy Realty Corp. (NYSE: KRC) was named a regional sector leader in the office category. Sara Neff, vice president for sustainability at Kilroy, noted that “a commitment to sustainability is the foundation of everything we do.”

GRESB’s Pyke pointed out that U.S. office REITs have made “outstanding progress” over the past few years, reaching overall performance levels that rival their top-scoring peers in Australia and New Zealand."
1737,"Commodities traders are ignoring the lessons of the Libor rigging scandal and not putting into place adequate safety measures to prevent market abuses, the City regulator has warned.

Banks and trading houses in the Square Mile are failing to monitor traders and often have inadequate surveillance systems, the regulator said.

The caution came after the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) conducted a review of 12 unnamed firms in the City, including brokers and trading houses involved in oil, metals and soft commodities dealing. In a document sent to City firms, the FCA warned: “Many firms had not embedded the lessons learned from recent market abuse cases (such as Libor, FX and Gold). On this point, our benchmark thematic work also urges firms to take note of the outcome of recent enforcement cases.”

Banks and traders in the City have been rocked by billions of dollars of fines and in some cases custodial sentences handed down for market abuses and rigging in recent years. Banks involved in the rigging of the London interbank offered rate (Libor) have been forced to pay over £4bn in penalties since the scandal was uncovered.

Last month, Tom Hayes , a 35-year-old trader, was sentenced to 14 years in prison after becoming the first person to be convicted by a British jury of rigging Libor.

The FCA added that many of the firms it reviewed in the commodities trading sector did not have adequate due diligence procedures in place to prevent, or report, such rogue traders.

In many cases that FCA said that firms “could not demonstrate they had adequate monitoring and surveillance across the full range of market abuse risks to which they were exposed. In addition, many firms could not demonstrate effective procedures to identify suspicious transactions and escalate them to the FCA.”"
1999,"Chris Maguire appeared to be a wealthy financial wizard to many people. He lived in a waterfront home in Windermere, drove Lamborghinis and bought houses and cars for his friends.  But federal authorities are saying in court filings that it was part of the latest Ponzi scheme in Central Florida.

Maguire’s alleged fraud was at least $13.4 million in scope and fleeced several people associated with Christian churches and organizations -- including the pastor of a black church near Tampa, Ron Ellis, who is suing Maguire for $2 million in losses, according to allegations filed in state and federal courts.

Ellis’ church itself, Exalted Word Ministries, claims losses of $30,000, according to a lawsuit.

Maguire, 33, was held on a civil contempt-of-court charge in December in connection with a lawsuit filed by one investor, but he was released on a promise he would provide more information about his finances. His whereabouts are unknown. A federal judge has issued a new civil order to arrest Maguire, known as a writ of bodily attachment.

Maguire is not facing formal criminal charges yet, but the alleged scheme is described in detail in multiple civil lawsuits and federal complaints to seize property. Attempts to reach him and attorneys who have represented him were unsuccessful.

One complaint filed by the U.S. Attorney’s office in Tampa described Maguire’s scheme in a 12-page document:

-- From 2012 to April 2014, Maguire told people he ran a financial company, usually Vivid Funding LLC, that provided “proof of funds” letters for corporations.

-- Maguire told investors that he was hired by corporations, and they would use Maguire’s bank accounts to show that they had assets when applying for new bank loans. He told investors they could get big returns on their money if they invested, and their money would be held in a trust account.

-- In reality, the feds allege, Maguire never used the money as described. Instead, he allegedly pooled the money in one slush fund and paid out large payments to previous investors, the classic definition of a Ponzi scheme. Authorities allege that he siphoned off about $4 million for personal expenses, like cars and houses.

-- Maguire described another company in his name, M-Development Inc., as being involved somehow in mobile application software.

One of Maguire’s alleged victims, Robert G. Noble Jr. of Orange County, sued him last year for $450,000. The court ordered Maguire to pay the money, but he hasn’t yet. Circuit Court Judge John Jordan ordered Maguire to be picked up by local authorities until he provided information about where the money was.

According to court records, Maguire spent a few months in jail and was released again so he could work on gathering the financial information required.

Noble’s attorney, Gary Salzman, questioned Maguire under oath at that time about the investments.

“What he told me didn’t make much sense, frankly,” Salzman said. “He was ingratiating himself with these people, driving around in Lamborghinis, hobnobbing with the wealthy, and that’s how he’s getting their trust. He was documenting these loans, and paid out some returns, but then it ended.”

Another alleged victim was Marvin Weed of New Hampshire, who filed suit against Maguire and M-Development for $142,000.

The U.S. Attorney’s office has also identified a financial adviser who helped Maguire -- William Peterseim, formerly of Longwood and now of Wesley Chapel, near Tampa.  Peterseim was described as helping to steer investors to Maguire, in a federal complaint filed in Tampa to seize Peterseim’s home.

Peterseim has denied knowing about Maguire's alleged fraud. In the complaint, federal authorities said Maguire bought a house for Peterseim, paid directly out of the slush fund account.

Attempts to reach Maguire or Peterseim, and their attorneys, were not immediately successful. Several phone numbers associated with both men were longer in service.

In his deposition with Salzman, Maguire described paying for Peterseim’s house with funds that were mixed together from various investors, including Noble’s money: “The capital account we're using at the time was mixed. Other monies come from -- I got, you know, had four or five different accounts, so ... It didn't go from like JR's (Noble’s) account to his account, but it was money that was mixed in the pot.”

In the same deposition, Maguire said some of the money had been moved to overseas bank accounts.

The most recent filing in the case happened Tuesday, when federal authorities filed a motion to seize and sell a car Maguire allegedly bought for his girlfriend, Rebecca Kauffman of the Orlando area.

The Sentinel requested more information from the U.S. Attorney's office in Tampa, including the status of the investigation and Maguire's current whereabouts; a spokesman declined to comment."
2016,"At U.S. Open, the Ball Boys and Girls Are Grown-Ups"
2322,"GLAAD, the nation’s LGBT media advocacy organization, today released the ninth edition of its Network Responsibility Index, which maps the quantity, quality, and diversity of LGBT representation on television.

Among broadcast networks, Fox stood out with 45 percent of its prime-time programming being LGBT-inclusive. Ratings smash Empire and the final season of Glee (pictured above) added heavy doses of diversity. The comedy Brooklyn Nine-Nine and the reality competition So You Think You Can Dance also contributed to LGBT visibility on Fox.

""The ninth edition of the NRI marks the first time in the report's history that a major broadcast network — Fox — received an ‘Excellent’ grade,"" said GLAAD CEO and president Sarah Kate Ellis. ""This milestone highlights real change across the media landscape — especially considering that the network received a ‘Failing’ grade in the NRI's first two editions.""

Among cable networks, ABC Family earned its third consecutive “Excellent” grade with 74 percent LGBT-inclusive hours, thanks to multiracial LGBT characters and storylines on Pretty Little Liars (pictured above), The Fosters, Chasing Life, Switched at Birth, Young & Hungry, and Mystery Girls.

Broadcast networks earning a “Good” rating include the CW (The Flash, Arrow [pictured above], America’s Next Top Model), which led in racial diversity of its LGBT characters, with 38 percent of impressions being made by people of color. It had the second-highest percentage of inclusive programming hours, with 44.8 percent of its original programming hours featuring LGBT characters.

On ABC, no one oversaw more LGBT-inclusive hours of television than Shonda Rhimes, creator of Grey’s Anatomy, Scandal, and How to Get Away With Murder (pictured above). Modern Family and Dancing With the Stars also upped ABC’s gay ante. But while 32 percent of LGBT-inclusive hours in ABC’s total programming earned it a “Good” rating, only 17 percent of the network's LGBT impressions were made by people of color, the lowest of any broadcast network.

CBS remains languishing at the bottom of the broadcast networks, with 27 percent of programming featuring LGBT characters or storylines, most of which came from its reality shows like Survivor, The Amazing Race, and Big Brother (pictured above).

Cable networks earning a “Good” rating include Showtime, HBO, and MTV (with 41 percent, 31 percent and 30 percent LGBT-inclusive hours respectively). “Failing” grades went to A&E (with a paltry 8 percent) and History, with zero LGBT-inclusive hours of programming — proving that the History Channel is on the wrong side of history. (Pictured above: the History Channel's The Bible)

GLAAD also announced that this is the final edition of its NRI, and the organization will now turn its focus to increasing the diversity of LGBT images on TV through its annual Where We Are on TV Report.

""GLAAD’s Network Responsibility Index has helped reshape the television landscape, inspiring LGBT characters and storylines that move acceptance forward,"" Ellis said. ""As representations of LGBT people in the media continue to rise in number, pushing television networks to make those representations more diverse is more crucial than ever. This requires a different set of tools than the NRI provides, and as such GLAAD will shift focus to its annual TV diversity and transgender reports."""
1754,"The country has been front and center over the last few weeks, with its volatile stock market and its newly devalued currency.

But, importantly, this decline isn't an isolated event.

Since China is such a big player in the global economy, and a major trading partner of many countries, its slowdown will inevitably hit other countries. And HSBC economists point out that commodities are a particularly vulnerable sector in this stagnating climate.

""Given China's role as the world's biggest commodity consumer, any slowdown adversely affects prices significantly. Copper prices are down more than 20% from recent highs, and oil is down roughly 40%,"" writes HSBC economist James Pomeroy.

Take a look below just how thirsty China is for commodities:"

It's been a wild few days for crude but one energy analyst sees one of the biggest buying opportunities for oil and oil-related companies.

After rallying some 25 percent from the middle of last week through Monday, the price of a barrel of oil (CLV15.NYM) dropped 8% on Tuesday. Manufacturing data from China added to worries about the country’s economic growth and demand for energy.

The supply side also shows the potential for lower crude pries in the near term, according to Ted Izatt, chief strategy officer at SDKA International. He sees expected additional oil from Iran, Iraq, and not much decline from American producers are harkening back to another time in crude’s history – 1998, when barrels traded below $11.

“I’m not saying they will go down that far,” Izatt said. “I’m just pointing out that the situation is such that they could go down. I think that when you get down to the low $40s, $30s, that’s a much more reasonable situation.”

Comparing oil to the natural gas energy equivalent would price crude in the high $20 level, claims Izatt. “There is definitely a little more downside risk here near term,” he concluded.

Lower prices will have a stimulus effect on global growth, Izatt predicted.

“There is over $6 billion a day of money going back into the [global] economy because of these lower oil prices,” he said. “That will take time for us to see but you are going to see better and better economic numbers due to that.”

But he also anticipates that lower prices will also lead producers like OPEC, Russia, and the United States will simultaneously pull back on supply. “You’re going to have a decline in production in the U.S. as capital spending is reduced,"" said Izatt.

The net result will be a rebound in in oil prices sometime in 2016. For Izatt, that makes oil and oil-related companies a buy.

“A reasonable price into next year might be in sort of the $50 to $60 range,” he said. “It’s hard to predict the exact timing of all these things. That why from an investor’s standpoint people need to be working their way into these investments now because it’s hard to know exactly when it will occur.”

599,"The August unemployment rate plunged to 5.1% — the lowest unemployment rate since April 2008.

But the economy added only 173,000 jobs last month, below the consensus forecast of 217,000.

Since this could potentially be the final major economic data point before the Federal Reserve decides whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in 9 years at its September meeting, people are making a really big deal over this report.

First of all, as Deutsche Bank's Joe Lavorgna had pointed out earlier, job gains have missed consensus forecasts in 21 out of the last 27 years in August. And as it turns out, history repeated itself this year with that 173,000.



And second, although August payrolls usually print low when they first come out, they are later revised up, as Pantheon Economics' chief economist Ian Shepherdson pointed out in a recent note to clients.

If you look at the chart below, you will see the initial August estimate (in turquoise) compared with the net revision (in forest green) since 2010. As Shepherdson puts it, ""The patterns are very clear.""

So basically, that 173,000 might be lowballing what's actually happening in the economy — and could be revised higher in the future."
367,"Ghana was one of Africa's fastest growing economies, with exports of gold, cocoa and oil, but since 2013 its economy has endured a stubborn deficit, inflation above government forecasts, and a debt-to-GDP ratio of nearly 70 percent.

The West African country entered the $918 million programme in April and the board approved the $116.6 million disbursement after a positive first review conducted at staff level in June.

""The government should firmly continue with its fiscal consolidation efforts to fully restore macroeconomic stability and mitigate financing risk,"" it said in a statement.

Controlling the wage bill is crucial for achieving expenditure controls and the government must remain committed to its domestic arrears clearance plan, it said.

Economists say the acid test of the government's ability to adhere to the deal will rise in the run-up to a 2016 election that is likely to be closely fought between incumbent John Mahama and opposition leader Nana Akufo-Addo.

To manage its expenditure next year, the government should identify election costs as early as possible and provide for them in the 2016 budget, the board said. The government must also not exceed its wage bill target in talks with unions.

Ghana is set to issue Eurobonds of up to $1.5 billion in September as well as medium and long-term domestic securities to restructure debt and finance infrastructure projects.

The Board said while externally-oriented financing envisaged in 2015 will help reduce the pressure on the domestic debt market, the government should deepen the domestic debt market while exploring external concessionary loans.

It urged the central bank to continue its tight monetary policy stance to help bring inflation down, against the background of exchange rate volatility."

2057,"LONDON (Alliance News) - Petroceltic International PLC's largest shareholder stepped up its long running debate with the company on Thursday after publishing an open letter alleging the company has committed ""fraud and corruption"".

Petroceltic shares were down 5.1% to 51.25 pence per share on Thursday morning.

Worldview Capital Management has a 29% stake in the oil company and the pair have been exchanging words since back in 2014. Worldview has previously had concerns over the management at the company and its finances.

However, on Thursday, Worldview released an open letter to Petroceltic which claimed Petroceltic's Project Director Geoff Stevenson, who is in charge of the company's Ain Tsila gas field development in Algeria, ""as well as members of his family"" have committed ""fraud and corruption"".

""We write to seek clarification for shareholders in respect of certain allegations which have recently appeared in the public domain relating to alleged fraud and corruption which may have taken place in the management of Petroceltic?s Algerian project,"" it said.

Worldview said it has filed the letter following on from ""public allegations"", which allege Stevenson may have benefited from ""a scheme designed to ""defraud the company"" by hiring contractors through a company called Petroplan using ""overstated invoices"". The letter also alleges Petroceltic awarded the front end engineering and design contract for the project to Petroplan ""on a questionable basis"".

Worldview also said that Stevenson is not thought to be the project director any longer.

""If correct, these public allegations suggest that shareholder value may have been compromised by the overpayment for services and/or funds being fraudulently diverted away from Petroceltic and thus its shareholders,"" said Worldview.

Worldview has submitted a list of questions to Petroceltic to try and gather some clarity over the situation, including what the company has done to investigate the allegations, if Stevenson is still in charge of the project, whether Petroceltic is aware of any ""wrongdoing"" and what the rationale was for using Petroplan for the project.

""As the largest shareholder in Petroceltic, and following our sustained and constant efforts over the last 14 months to proactively engage with the Board to improve Petroceltic's governance, we are disappointed to again raise issues that, if substantiated, further evidence a culture of inappropriate and failed governance,"" said Worldview.

The open letter and allegations come ahead of an extraordinary general meeting due to be held on September 7 for shareholders to vote on a separate issue raised by Worldview, which wants shareholders to vote in favour of its proposals to restrict future asset disposals, something Petroceltic has disagreed with.

Worldview has tabled a resolution that proposes Petroceltic should seek approval from shareholders for any material asset disposals which represent 25% or more of the company's revenues, profits, or oil and gas reserves after claiming Petroceltic had ""run out of money"".

Petroceltic is currently proposing placing the Ain Tsila gas field as security for a bond issue, which has also ruffled Worldview's feathers. Worldview has called the proposed bond deal ""perilous to shareholders"".

Petroceltic has said Worldview is proposing the resolution and fighting its bond plans as part of an ""ongoing strategy"" to gain control over the board. It argues that the company is already subject to rules on the disposal of assets, and the proposed resolution is contrary to the applicable standards set out in these rules."

The European Commission has 25 working days after a deal is filed for a first-stage review. It may extend that by 10 working days to 35 working days, to consider either a company's proposed remedies or an EU member state's request to handle the case.

Most mergers win approval but occasionally the Commission opens a detailed second-stage investigation for up to 90 additional working days, which it may extend to 105 working days.

Under the simplified procedure, the Commission announces the clearance of uncontroversial first-stage mergers without giving any reason for its decision. Cases may be reclassified as non-simplified - that is, ordinary first-stage reviews - until they are approved. (Compiled by Foo Yun Chee)"
2365,"NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Domino's Pizza (DPZ - Get Report) is scheduled to release its 2015 second quarter earnings report before the market open on Thursday. Analysts estimate a year-over-year increase in earnings per share and revenue for the pizza chain's 2015 second quarter.

Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters are expecting Domino's Pizza to report earnings of 79 cents per share, on revenue of $489.39 million for the quarter ended June 2015.

Last year, Domino's reported adjusted earnings of 67 cents per diluted share, on revenue of $450.46 million for its 2014 second quarter.

Domino's Pizza stock closed down 0.14% to $118.62 on heavy trading volume on Wednesday afternoon.

Domino's Pizza, based in Ann Arbor, Mich., operates and franchises about 11,600 pizza stores in more than 75 markets.

Separately, TheStreet Ratings team rates DOMINO'S PIZZA INC as a Buy with a ratings score of B-. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation:

""We rate DOMINO'S PIZZA INC (DPZ) a BUY. This is driven by multiple strengths, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its revenue growth, good cash flow from operations, growth in earnings per share, increase in net income and solid stock price performance. We feel its strengths outweigh the fact that the company shows low profit margins.""

However, the offer represents an inadequate premium since it is lower than both the 52-week high of $10.27 per share and considerably lower than at least one Wall Street analyst price target of $40.00 per share

The investigation focuses on whether Blyth’s Board of Directors breached their fiduciary duties to the Company’s stockholders by failing to conduct a fair sales process and whether and by how much this proposed transaction undervalues the Company to the detriment of Blyth’s shareholders.

170,"Wall Street may be torn about the direction of the global economy and when the Federal Reserve should raise benchmark interest rates, but bond traders appear to be bracing for an imminent move. (Tweet this.)

Short-dated Treasury debt yields, which are tied most closely to monetary policy forecasts, rose in August, with the two-year note yield logging its fifth straight monthly increase. That was its longest winning streak since 2006 when the Fed last raised interest rates.

Long-dated Treasury yields, often seen as a safe haven from stock market volatility, are virtually unchanged on the year, suggesting that bond investors are brushing off the panic about slowing global growth.

""As everyone tries to figure out what was said in Jackson Hole, I think the market is speaking that there is still a possibility that the Fed raises in September,"" said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at the Lindsey Group. ""I think it's still 50/50, but when the two-year yield's back above 70 basis points that means that market participants have put it back on the table as a possibility.""

Treasury yields gave back some gains this week as U.S. stocks tumbled after poor manufacturing data out of China and the U.S. spurred renewed worries of a global slowdown.

The yield drifted below 0.70 Thursday as stocks looked for some modest gains after a selloff earlier in the week.

Bond traders expect the market to remain volatile going into the August jobs report on Friday as it could be a key decider of whether the Fed moves off its near-zero level.

If the payrolls number is in line with expectations of an addition of 220,000 jobs, the Federal Open Market Committee could be more inclined to raise interest rates at the end of its Sept. 16-17 meeting. But that could be the last raise for a while, according to Boockvar."

1475,"Mumbai/New Delhi: The government will probably reduce the price of natural gas next month by about 14%, dealing a potential blow to explorers Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) and Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC).

The government-set price will track a global decline and fall to less than $4 per million British thermal units for October through March from $4.66, the average of 12 industry estimates in a Bloomberg News survey shows. India reviews the cost half-yearly, using a formula capturing international trends.

A reduction could squeeze profits and curb the scope for gas investment at state-run ONGC and billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries even as India struggles to stem a drop in output. Power producers and fertilizer makers stand to benefit from a price cut, as does the government’s budget balance since India subsidizes fertilizer to keep it affordable for farmers.

“Globally, gas prices have slumped, which means there will be a sharp drop in Indian prices,” said Deepak Mahurkar, leader for the oil and gas team at PricewaterhouseCoopers in India. That isn’t a good backdrop for the health of the industry or spurring exploration, he said.

India’s gas-price formula is based on US, Canadian, UK and Russian rates. A shale production boom in the US, a slide in Russia’s ruble and a tumble in crude oil, a common index for gas rates, have depressed prices. Natural gas futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange have dropped about 31% in the past year.

India’s gas price based on the gross heat value may fall to $3.8-$3.9 per mmBtu, according to Nitin Zamre, managing director of Indian operations at ICF International Inc., a consulting firm in Fairfax, Virginia.

BP Plc, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BHP Billiton Ltd are among companies that have written off or delayed billions of dollars of investment in the gas sector around the world. In India, ONGC and Reliance produce almost all of the fuel extracted locally.

While prices today may be low, ONGC is taking investment decisions for the long term, New Delhi-based chairman Dinesh Kumar Sarraf said in an interview.

“It’s only spot prices that are falling, and we produce for many, many years,” he said.

In October last year, Sarraf estimated that each $1 increase in the price of gas boosts ONGC’s annual profit by Rs.2,350 crore.

Tushar Pania, a spokesman for Reliance, didn’t reply to an e-mail seeking comment on the upcoming gas revision.

India’s natural gas production fell to 33.7 billion cubic meters in the 12 months through 31 March, a four-year low, according to the oil ministry. Output from Reliance’s KG-D6 block in the Bay of Bengal fell 13% to 37 billion cubic feet in April to June from a year ago.

Reliance, owner of the world’s biggest refining complex, has argued that India needs higher prices to stimulate exploration and output growth. Geological conditions have hampered KG-D6 production, according to the company.

“A lot of these players are not as enthusiastic today as they were earlier,” ICF’s Zamre said. Bloomberg"

The European Commission has 25 working days after a deal is filed for a first-stage review. It may extend that by 10 working days to 35 working days, to consider either a company's proposed remedies or an EU member state's request to handle the case.

Most mergers win approval but occasionally the Commission opens a detailed second-stage investigation for up to 90 additional working days, which it may extend to 105 working days.

Under the simplified procedure, the Commission announces the clearance of uncontroversial first-stage mergers without giving any reason for its decision. Cases may be reclassified as non-simplified - that is, ordinary first-stage reviews - until they are approved. (Compiled by Foo Yun Chee)"
1336,"Oil is at the lowest price we have seen in more than 10 years and there is no evidence that the price has bottomed. We believe the price crash for oil is very similar to what occurred in 1986, and the overall reason is due to a great increase of supply.

In 1986, the increase come from Saudi Arabia; today it is from the U.S. So how can investors play oil's decline?

First, some background: from 1980 to 1986, OPEC decreased oil production several times to maintain high prices. Saudi Arabia went from producing close to 10 million barrels per day in 1980 to about 3.5 million barrels per day in 1985. OPEC was supposed to be on a quota system by country, but (no surprise) many members were cheating. In the fall of 1985, the Saudis became tired of losing market share, so they began greatly increasing their production.

Does keeping market share ring a bell with today's headlines? This caused an oversupply and the price of oil dropped 67 percent between November 1985 and March 1986. The U.S. is now the swing producer in the world, with annual oil production up more than 80 percent since 2008. All this new supply has caused a devastating impact on price. Since June 2014, oil is down more than 60 percent. This has caused the price of most oil-related stocks to fall dramatically. For example, the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (ticker: XLE) is down 35 percent over the past year. With the steep decline in prices, many investors are looking to pick up some bargains, but in this regard, not all parts of the oil industry are equal.

The energy industry, as it relates to oil companies, can be broken down broadly into the following sub-sectors: exploration and production, service, refining and marketing and integrated companies. The integrated companies are the large companies that are most familiar, such as Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and Chevron Corp. (CVX). They have operations in practically all sub-industries. Taking these categories into consideration, here are a few things investors should keep in mind when looking for bargains in oil investments:

Not all oil sub-sectors are the same. Investors should resist the urge to buy the stocks that have fallen the most – the exploration and production companies and the service companies. Using 1986 as a guide, we find even after the price of oil had increased by more than 30 percent from its bottom, the integrated companies and refining and marketing companies greatly outperformed the other oil sectors.

Exploration slowdown. Exploration for new sources of oil will likely stay subdued until oil finds a new base price and trades in a tight range around that price for some time. Currently, most exploration and production companies are faced with large debts that will be maturing over the next year or two. They will likely remain in a price environment where many of them will go broke or be forced to sell to the larger integrated companies at bargain prices. If companies aren't exploring and putting in new wells, the service companies suffer.

A refining advantage. In contrast to exploration and production companies, the refining and marketing companies have real benefits. They are not dependent on the price of the commodity. With a cheaper price for oil, they are able to expand their margins and demand for product.

If you are looking for bargains in the oil industry we suggest you focus on the large integrated companies and refiners. Consider an integrated entity, such as Exxon. The company has a stellar balance sheet and pays a dividend of 4 percent. For a refining and marketing company, take a look at Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC). The company trades around seven times cash flow and has a dividend yield of approximately 2.7 percent, which it has been been steadily increasing.

As of this writing, Bob Phillips owned shares of XOM, as do firm clients.

282,"Romania’s Chamber of Deputies approved the new Fiscal Code on Thursday, September 3, after the Senate had voted it two days before. The law will enter into force after it is promulgated by President Klaus Iohannis, but most of the measures will apply starting January 1, 2016.

The Parliament first approved the new Fiscal Code in June, but President Iohannis refused to sign it and sent it back for review asking the senators and deputies to temper the fiscal relaxation measures proposed for next year.

The political parties represented in the parliament, together with the Government, reviewed the tax cuts and only kept one: the VAT rate cut from 24% to 20%, starting January 2016. The rest of the tax cuts were either postponed for 2017 or removed completely.

According to the new Fiscal Code, the VAT rate will be cut again from 20% to 19%, in January 2017. The removal extra excise on fuel and the tax on special buildings will also be kept in 2016 and only removed in January 2017 if the code isn’t changed again by then. The tax on special buildings will only be removed for companies in agriculture starting January 2016.

The initial fiscal relaxation measures the Government announced at the beginning of this year included lower dividend tax, lower social security contributions and even a lower flat tax rate, to be implemented gradually. All of these tax cuts have disappeared from the new Fiscal Code.

Instead of tax cuts, some taxes will be increased next year, namely property taxes to be paid to local authorities. The new Fiscal Code changes the way property taxes for individuals are set, which may lead to significant increases. The local authorities will also be able to charge higher taxes for unattended buildings and land plots.

1117,"Pepco and Exelon will press an appeal to the D.C. Public Service Commission to reconsider their proposed $6.4 billion merger following last week’s rejection by the three-member regulatory panel.

“We remain convinced the decision fails to recognize the substantial immediate and long-term benefits of our merger proposal to citizens, businesses and communities in the District of Columbia,” the two utilities said in a joint statement Monday. “We believe our merger proposal is in the public interest, and we will continue working to complete the merger, which all other jurisdictions have approved.”

The companies did not detail their next step, but they have 30 days from Thursday of last week to file a petition to the PSC for reconsideration. Once the commission receives the filing, it has 30 days to grant or deny the request. The commission can also do nothing, which is essentially a denial, according to a spokesman.

If the PSC agrees to take up the reconsideration, it typically will detail the next steps in its response.

The utilities may appeal to the D.C. Court of Appeals, but not before they exhaust their avenues with the city regulator. They can also file a new application with the PSC.

The merger has been approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission; the Justice Department; and regulators in Maryland, Delaware and New Jersey. But opponents in the District have dug in.

“We still think it’s a bad deal,” said Matt Gravatt, the chair of the D.C. chapter of the Sierra Club, which was part of a coalition that opposed the proposed merger. “I don’t anticipate our position changing. [The initial application] didn’t advance the environmental and clean-energy goals that D.C. has embraced.”

“There’s room to secure a fair deal for the ratepayer that would allow the region to benefit from a strong and committed utility partner,” said Kevin Clinton, chief operating officer of the Federal City Counsel, a pro-business D.C. civic organization. “A merged company will be more reliable and a stronger local partner.”

The companies announced in April 2014 that Chicago-based nuclear energy giant Exelon would be acquiring Pepco in an all-cash transaction, which is a $2.5 billion premium above the value of the Washington-based utility’s assets before the announcement.

Exelon has tried to sweeten the deal with commitments such as maintaining local operational headquarters, including the District, where the utility promised no merger-related job losses for at least two years, keeping two key local executives in charge and an increase in charitable donations for the next decade above Pepco’s 2013 level of $1.6 million per year.

The utilities also agreed to reliability improvements, including a project to run some power lines underground. The utility agreed to pay up to $5.6 million in penalties if it does not achieve certain reliability objectives."
2240,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Truck and engine maker Navistar International Corp on Wednesday reported its 12th consecutive quarterly loss and said it could face regulatory enforcement action for its disclosure practices, sending its shares down nearly 7 percent.

The company said it suffered from restructuring and product warranty costs and poor sales in Brazil and Mexico.

Navistar said it received Wells notices from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that recommended enforcement action against the company and former Chief Executive Officer Daniel Ustian for allegedly violating regulations of disclosures and financial statements.

A Wells notice usually gives the recipient one last chance to persuade regulators not to file a lawsuit.

During a conference call with analysts, Navistar officials said they could not comment on the case beyond saying the company was working on its response to the Wells notices.

The SEC staff may also recommend the agency pursue action involving Navistar's Environmental Protection Agency certification and disclosures about Ustian's exit in August 2012.

The SEC has been sending Navistar subpoenas since 2012 as part of a probe into whether the company misstated its efforts to win EPA certification that its engines comply with clean air laws.

Navistar has been struggling with high warranty costs for an emission reduction system that failed to meet regulatory standards in 2012.

The net loss attributable to Navistar widened to $28 million, or 34 cents per share, in the third quarter ended on July 31 from $2 million, or 2 cents per share, a year earlier.

Revenue fell nearly 11 percent to $2.54 billion, below the analysts' average estimate of $2.75 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The company said poor economic conditions in Brazil and Mexico, plus the strong U.S. dollar, hurt its results.

Navistar executives said during the conference call that ongoing restructuring actions would help the company become profitable and have positive cash flow in 2016.

The company said it had seen a marked increase in interest from U.S. customers for its new trucks.

In morning New York Stock Exchange trading, Navistar shares were down 6.7 percent at $16.19. At Tuesday's close, the stock had fallen about 48 percent this year, compared with a 16.2 percent decline in the Dow Jones U.S. commercial vehicles & trucks index .

393,"The International Monetary Fund faces a stern test of its independence that could have repercussions far beyond the fate of the Greek economy, by far its biggest headache of the moment.

Euro-zone finance ministers are expected to approve a new rescue deal for Greece after months of contentious negotiations on debt relief and austerity ended in the capitulation of Greece’s left-wing government to its creditors. Those creditors include other euro zone governments, the European Central Bank, and the IMF.

The talks have led Greek leaders to vote today on further cuts to public spending and reforms designed to liberalize its sclerotic labor markets and clear failed loans from the books of its overwhelmed banks. These moves are expected to unlock a three-year bailout agreement worth some €85 billion ($95 billion)—or at least a bridge loan to cover a €3.2 billion bond repayment due to the ECB next week.

Nonetheless, the IMF has made clear that Greece’s debt load, expected to balloon to more than twice its annual economic output in 2016, is not sustainable without some form of relief—that is, a meaningful reduction in what Athens owes. The IMF’s rules prohibit lending to countries with so much debt that they are not able to pay the fund back. That means even though the IMF endorses the reforms required by the new Greek bailout agreement, it likely won’t sign on to participate in this new loan program unless there is enough debt relief to make repayment a reasonable possibility.

While the IMF’s financial contribution would be welcome, what’s more important to Greece’s other creditors is the organization’s imprimatur as the global financial authority. This eases the passage of the bailout program in Europe’s parliaments, especially Berlin’s, where IMF participation is considered an essential condition for approval.

Now, Germany’s finance ministry is criticizing the proposed bailout terms as too lenient, even as it insists that the IMF and its director, former French finance minister Christine Lagarde, must sign off on a program that breaks the fund’s rules.

The last time this happened, with Greece’s first bailout in 2010, the IMF eventually broke under the pressure.

“The IMF was strong-armed into lending to Greece at massive scale in 2010,” Brett House, a former IMF staffer who is now chief economist at Alignvest Investment Management, told Quartz. “The board overrode the IMF’s own rules against lending into unsustainable situations and, in a terrible governance move, rewrote the IMF’s policies in the midst of its lending decision to make the loan to Greece possible.”

The IMF wants to “escape from the cloud of perception that it has been captured by Europe.” Then-IMF director Dominique Strauss-Kahn recently wrote that he felt the IMF had no choice but to join the EU to rescue Greece the first time, when a weakened global financial system faced broader exposure to the country’s economic troubles. But even he expressed regret for misdiagnosing the problem and now urges Greece’s creditors to adopt a policy of debt relief.

Can the IMF stick to its principles this time around? The odds may be better, in part thanks to divisions in Europe. The ECB and the European Commission wrote their own reports today expressing concerns that Greece’s debt is still not sustainable, concluding that debt relief will be necessary.

The other factor that strengthens the IMF’s hand is the US position—Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has endorsed debt relief for Greece and remained engaged with the negotiations over the summer.

“Whether the IMF holds to its position or not depends entirely on the US Treasury,” House says. He adds:

But if the IMF bows again to European officials’ insistence that regional politics trump economic reality, it will lose further credibility before the developing economies that are grasping a growing share of global economic power. House says the fund wants to “escape from the cloud of perception that it has been captured by Europe.”

But it may be too late. David Lipton, the American deputy director of the IMF, recently said he expects an end to the informal practice that the fund’s director come from Europe.

“The fact that there’s been so much focus on crisis in the United States right at the early stages of the global financial crisis and with Europe, is going to lead to a sense that there has to be a broader pool for the leadership role,” he told the BBC."

Lineage



The 2007-registered P.B. Films Ltd (PBFL) is said to be a film production house based in Kolkata, with a vision to make commercial and art films. The company produced the first film “Mr. Fantoosh” which was released in the year 2008. Since then, it has produced thirteen more Bengali films till November 2014 and few are said to be under process of production. Even though PBFL is having as many as 225 shareholders, as on the date of filing of this Prospectus, Pankaj Agrawal (39), Nirmalkunj Merchandise Ltd and Premkunj Distributor Ltd (both incorporated on the same day, January 21, 2014) are presented as promoters of PBFL.



PBFL’s group seems to have connections with hordes of companies. Nevertheless only the following eleven private limited entities are called group companies: 1. Neptune Goods Pvt Ltd, 2. Straight Line Food Products Pvt Ltd, 3. Ashirvad Corn Products Pvt Ltd, 4. Maharaja Commercial Pvt Ltd, 5. Rosewood Vinimay Pvt Ltd, 6. Natraj Tradecom Pvt Ltd, 7. Reet Advisors Pvt Ltd, 8. Well View Dealcom Pvt Ltd, 9. Ranbhumi Vincom Pvt Ltd, 10. Monarch Nirmans Pvt Ltd, 11. Ultimate Vacations Pvt Ltd. 



The following companies have a noticeable stake in the so called group companies of PBFL: 1. Albino Investment Consultans Pvt Ltd, 2. Atlantic Investment Advisory Pvt Ltd, 3. Nityadhara Business Ltd, 4. Madhudhan Vyapaar Ltd, 5. Himalayan Investment Consultants Pvt Ltd, 6. Harekrishna Vyapaar Pvt Ltd, 7. Jupiter Projects Pvt Ltd, 8.

Hem Textile & Trading Company Pvt Ltd, 14. Synox Marketing Pvt Ltd, 15. Plus Jet Finvest Pvt Ltd,16. Lopax Marketing Pvt Ltd, 17. D S Consultancy & Holding Pvt Ltd,18.Atindra Infrastructure Pvt Ltd (formerly Rukmani Tie Up Pvt Ltd), 19. Anushree Tie Up Pvt Ltdand 20.Sanatan Vinimay Pvt Ltd. Nonetheless, no details about these companies are available in the offer document. 



PBFL has invested in the following closely-held companies at premium during the past couple of years: Mica Mold Finserv Pvt Ltd (25 lakh), Kalahanu Trading Ltd (Rs 20 lakh), Tirupati Ashray Pvt Ltd (Rs 50 lakh) Capital Audio Video Pvt Ltd (Rs 15 lakh) Erudit Shares and Securities Pvt Ltd (Rs 15 lakh), Marble Finvest Pvt Ltd (Rs 21 lakh), Kalahanu Retail Pvt Ltd (15 lakh), Tarouna Cold Storage Pvt Ltd  (Rs15 lakh), Shree Hari Om Ores and Minerals Pvt Ltd (18 lakh), Lokhnath Commotrade Pvt Ltd (Rs 15 lakh) and Svaraj Trading and Agencies Ltd (Rs 116 lakh). However, the back ground details of these companies are not disclosed. 



The nature of the companies that the promoters have associated with gives a feeling that PBFL’s promoters are more interested in investments and `money conversion’ than any other credible business. It is worth noting here that some of the companies, where PBFL has invested in the past and also some companies from whom PBFL group companies have received investments, are also involved in some of the BSE- 



Financial Track



As regards PBFL’s financial performance, its track record is far from stable. Of the last five years, Operating income has fluctuated between Rs 7 lakh and Rs 508 lakh. Whenever operating revenue dropped, the company thrived on `other income’. Yet, the company has failed to generate net cash from its activities.



 















































Valuation & Perception



PBFL is offering shares only at par value (Rs 10) though three years ago it had issued at Rs 500 to Active Tie-up Pvt Ltd (20,000 shares), Omkara Investment Advisory Pvt Ltd (20,000), Ratnamani Financial Advisory Pvt Ltd (30,000) and Standard Barter Pvt Ltd (20,000). Earlier, in 2009 the company had issued shares at a price of Rs 200 a piece to Hill View Hire Purchase Pvt Ltd (2,000), Gemini Barter Pvt  Ltd (3,000), Sinjan Vinimay Pvt Ltd (9,500), Kritika Vyapaar Pvt Ltd (3,250), Anushree Tie- Up Pvt Ltd (2,000), Durbhasha Distributors Pvt Ltd (12,500), Mandyati Dealcom Pvt  Ltd (5,000), Modern Publicity Pvt Ltd (7,500), Vijay Lakhmi Vanijya Pvt Ltd (5,000).



Of the above 1.39,750 shares, as many as 1,00,250 shares were bought by PBFL’s corporate promoters  Premkunj Distributor Ltd and Nirmalkunj Merchandise Ltd on January 29, 2014 at a throw-away price of Rs 2 per share which was followed by a bumper 57:2 bonus (28,57,125 shares) on 07/02/2014. In other words, while the public is asked to shell out Rs 10, the promoter-companies’ cost is just 7paise! The seller companies might have booked capital losses, which they could have used to set off against the capital gains they would have made from other transactions. The promoter entities, by buying the shares at a very low rate, have indirectly indicated the true worth of the company which is being taken public!



In fact, PBFL has many other interesting aspects too. In five years between 2008 and 2013, the company has changed its registered office as many as four times. Dinesh Kumar Agarwal was wrongly appointed as “Promoter Non Executive Director” on October 31, 2013 but the same was realized and change in his designation form was filed on December 13, 2014. Also, Sanjay Kumar Agarwal was wrongly appointed as “Promoter Non Executive Director"" on October 26, 2012. What’s more in 2010-11 RSVA & Co. was appointed in the place Agarwal A & Co. as the latter wished to resign due to pre-occupation. Next year, Agarwal A & Co. came back as RSVA & Co. wished to resign due to pre-occupation! Come 2014-15, RSVA & Co. was once again appointed as auditors since Agarwal A & Co. resigned due to pre-occupation!

Nine closely-held companies whose ownership and net worth are not revealed got allotment of 49,750 shares of Rs 10 each in 2009 at a price of Rs 200 a piece. Three years later another four companies of similar nature were allotted 90,000 shares at a price of Rs 500 each. Twenty months later, three companies of the first lot along with the second lot of four sell their entire holding aggregating to 1,00,250 shares (aggregate cost being Rs 470.50 lakh) to two just a week-old closely held promoter-companies for a paltry Rs 2 per share incurring an aggregate loss of Rs 469.50 lakh! Just 9 days after the buy-out, the company rewards with a 57:2 bonus gifting additional 27.57 lakh shares thereby reducing the average cost of the share to a minuscule 7 paise. Why did the seven companies sell their investment at 99.57% discount, that too just a few days before the bumper bonus? How were they compensated for the huge loss? Tax authorities have a clear cut case to look into.The present offer is a fresh issue of 50 lakh shares of Rs 10 each at par of which 2.6 lakh shares are reserved for market maker. The equity capital, which is at Rs 9.42 cr at present, will increase to Rs 14.42 cr. The IPO, constituting 34.68% of the equity, will further increase the equity capital to Rs 14.42 cr. The entire issue has been underwritten by the lead manager to the offer, Guiness Corporate Advisors. The lead manager’s associate company, Guiness Securities, will act as `market maker’. Investors have to apply for a minimum of 10000 shares (Rs 1 lakh).The objects of the IPO are to finance business expansion plans and achieve the benefits of listing. The company believes that listing will enhance its corporate image and brand name. Of the net proceeds of Rs 4.65 cr the company proposes to spend Rs 3.33 cr on production of two films. About Rs 1.07 cr is earmarked for publicity and distribution of two films and the balance Rs 25 lakh is kept for general corporate purpose.The 2007-registered P.B. Films Ltd (PBFL) is said to be a film production house based in Kolkata, with a vision to make commercial and art films. The company produced the first film “Mr. Fantoosh” which was released in the year 2008. Since then, it has produced thirteen more Bengali films till November 2014 and few are said to be under process of production. Even though PBFL is having as many as 225 shareholders, as on the date of filing of this Prospectus, Pankaj Agrawal (39), Nirmalkunj Merchandise Ltd and Premkunj Distributor Ltd (both incorporated on the same day, January 21, 2014) are presented as promoters of PBFL.PBFL’s group seems to have connections with hordes of companies. Nevertheless only the following eleven private limited entities are called group companies: 1. Neptune Goods Pvt Ltd, 2. Straight Line Food Products Pvt Ltd, 3. Ashirvad Corn Products Pvt Ltd, 4. Maharaja Commercial Pvt Ltd, 5. Rosewood Vinimay Pvt Ltd, 6. Natraj Tradecom Pvt Ltd, 7. Reet Advisors Pvt Ltd, 8. Well View Dealcom Pvt Ltd, 9. Ranbhumi Vincom Pvt Ltd, 10. Monarch Nirmans Pvt Ltd, 11. Ultimate Vacations Pvt Ltd.The following companies have a noticeable stake in the so called group companies of PBFL: 1. Albino Investment Consultans Pvt Ltd, 2.

D S Consultancy & Holding Pvt Ltd,18.Atindra Infrastructure Pvt Ltd (formerly Rukmani Tie Up Pvt Ltd), 19. Anushree Tie Up Pvt Ltdand 20.Sanatan Vinimay Pvt Ltd. Nonetheless, no details about these companies are available in the offer document.PBFL has invested in the following closely-held companies at premium during the past couple of years: Mica Mold Finserv Pvt Ltd (25 lakh), Kalahanu Trading Ltd (Rs 20 lakh), Tirupati Ashray Pvt Ltd (Rs 50 lakh) Capital Audio Video Pvt Ltd (Rs 15 lakh) Erudit Shares and Securities Pvt Ltd (Rs 15 lakh), Marble Finvest Pvt Ltd (Rs 21 lakh), Kalahanu Retail Pvt Ltd (15 lakh), Tarouna Cold Storage Pvt Ltd  (Rs15 lakh), Shree Hari Om Ores and Minerals Pvt Ltd (18 lakh), Lokhnath Commotrade Pvt Ltd (Rs 15 lakh) and Svaraj Trading and Agencies Ltd (Rs 116 lakh). However, the back ground details of these companies are not disclosed.The nature of the companies that the promoters have associated with gives a feeling that PBFL’s promoters are more interested in investments and `money conversion’ than any other credible business. It is worth noting here that some of the companies, where PBFL has invested in the past and also some companies from whom PBFL group companies have received investments, are also involved in some of the BSE- SME s whose credentials are dicey.As regards PBFL’s financial performance, its track record is far from stable. Of the last five years, Operating income has fluctuated between Rs 7 lakh and Rs 508 lakh. Whenever operating revenue dropped, the company thrived on `other income’. Yet, the company has failed to generate net cash from its activities.PBFL is offering shares only at par value (Rs 10) though three years ago it had issued at Rs 500 to Active Tie-up Pvt Ltd (20,000 shares), Omkara Investment Advisory Pvt Ltd (20,000), Ratnamani Financial Advisory Pvt Ltd (30,000) and Standard Barter Pvt Ltd (20,000).

Many an IPO of Guiness has derived income from non-operating sources. For most of them, main activity is investment in shares! Many of Guiness IPOs have an unassuming promoter stake of less than 25%. The core promoters (individuals) would hold only a minuscule percentage of the post-issue equity and unknown entities acquire significant quantum of shares through private transfers either at exorbitant prices or at heavy discounts. Most of them have private placements with public category of investors before going public.The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

568,"WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) — The U.S. economy looks much more vigorous in the second quarter than previously thought, as a report released Thursday showed businesses got off the sidelines and spent some money.

The acceleration in business investment, if it’s sustained, could add to the economy’s momentum in the months ahead. The data show why the Federal Reserve is considering hiking interest rates at its next meeting in September.

The U.S. economy grew at a faster 3.7% annual pace in the second quarter, up from the initial estimate of growth at a 2.3% clip, the Commerce Department said Thursday.

Economists polled by MarketWatch forecast gross domestic product would be revised up to 3.3%, but business investment was stronger than expected. The government estimated last month that gross domestic product expanded at a seasonally adjusted 2.3% clip from April to June.

U.S. stocks, which have gyrated over the concerns about China’s economy, climbed on Thursday.

Consumer spending, the main driver of U.S. economic activity, led the way as usual. Outlays were revised up to 3.1% from 2.9% in the second quarter after a tepid 1.8% gain in the first three months of the year.

What’s more, newly revised figures from the Commerce Department show that businesses invested at an even faster rate.

Businesses increased investment by 3.2% increase of a drop of 0.6%, with spending on structures such as office buildings rising by 3.1% instead of a drop of 1.6%.

One reason businesses might have invested more: Corporate profits jumped an estimated 2.4% in the second quarter after declining by 5.8% in the first quarter.

And they boosted spending on equipment by 10.7%, rather than 7%..

It’s not clear this pace can be sustained. For instance, state and local government spending was boosted to 4.3% from 2.0%, the fastest pace since 2001. Economists don’t think this will last.

And the value of inventories, which adds to GDP, increased by $121.1 billion in the second quarter instead of a previously estimated $110.0 billion. This is expected to subtract from growth in the third and fourth quarter.

But real final sales to private domestic purchasers, a measure of activity without inventories, saw a stronger upward gain than many economists expected, from 2.5% to 3.3%.

Economists polled by MarketWatch forecast the U.S. will grow at a 2.8% pace in the July-September quarter. But that was before this week’s financial market volatility.

Inflation as measured by the PCE price index rose at a 2.2% annual rate.

William Dudley, the president of the New York Fed, said Wednesday that recent economic data has been pretty positive. He indicated that he had been at least very close to backing a rate hike at the Fed’s Sept. 16-17 meeting.

However, recent financial market turmoil has complicated the U.S. central bank’s plans. Dudley told reporters the steep market declines had made a rate increase “less compelling.”

It may be months before economists will know whether this week’s stock sell-off is an economically important shock.

“The key to the monetary policy stance in the near term will not be past growth or inflation performance, but the outlook for both,” said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities.

“And given the recent financial market volatility and the lingering anxiety about global growth, the outlook for both is now more uncertain and tilted to the downside, especially for inflation. This will provide the pretext for the Fed to take a pass on raising rates in September,” he added."
1283,"Jason Adkins, president of Unite Private Networks (UPN), says that while it may not as big as a Tier 1 provider or Zayo Networks, the provider is finding a growing niche in Tier 2 markets that incumbents have shown little interest in serving.

Having recently completed its hundredth tower fiber connection in its wholesale wireless backhaul business, UPN is seeing continual demand in the markets it serves, like Iowa, on three fronts: school districts, enterprises and wireless operators.

""Towers continue to be a big part of our organic growth and we continue to have a heavy concentration of school districts, and then enterprise,"" Adkins said. ""The big thing is taking these anchor customers like schools and wireless towers and layering on enterprise sales reps on top of that.""

Although UPN serves large markets like Dallas, it also operates in secondary markets such as Des Moines and Pueblo, Colo. One market where it is seeing growing opportunity for its fiber services in the enterprise segment is in Iowa, where a number of companies are looking for alternative diverse fiber providers, particularly for companies that are connected to the legacy McLeod fiber network.

""The last major fiber build in Iowa was probably 20 years ago with McLeod fiber and now we're coming in overbuilding with heavy count fiber,"" Adkins said. ""We're getting a lot of interest where people say they have a fiber route on the McLeod network, but I would love to have a diverse route.""

At the same time that UPN is expanding its network reach organically, it is aware that the market it operates in is moving through another wave of consolidation where larger players are buying regional fiber network players.

Adkins isn't afraid of the rapidly consolidating competitive market, but realizes that the players and the buyers in the market are changing.

""From an M&A perspective, I think you're going to see a lot of non-traditional folks get into the fiber market, whether it's tower companies or other private equity firms that never invested in fiber,"" Adkins said. ""You see that line tower company and fiber company blurring now so a lot of people that wanted to invest in towers are looking at fiber and are saying it's not much different than towers.""

Driven by the growing small cell movement, tower companies like Crown Castle have emerged as an interesting new consolidator in the fiber network market.

Earlier this year, the service provider purchased Sunesys, a subsidiary of Quanta Services, for about $1 billion in cash. By acquiring Sunesys, the company will have fiber assets that could potentially serve more than 3,500 small cell opportunities.

 

 For its own part, Adkins said that it would consider acquiring other assets if they fit the right profile in terms of price and market reach.

""As far as M&A goes, we're not opposed to growing inorganically if we found the right tuck-in acquisition or a similar company we could bring into the fold,"" Adkins said. ""The question is always price and motivation.""

1268,"Healthcare leaders are abuzz with speculation about how the mergers of four insurance giants will affect the hospital systems that must do business with them, but those worries may be premature.

Analysts familiar with how federal regulators scrutinize such deals say it is far from certain that either the Aetna/Humana or Anthem/ Cigna mergers will be approved.

The Department of Justice is known to be aggressive in assessing potential mergers of large business entities, and the size of the proposed insurer mergers will guarantee a thorough examination, says Tom Kelly, former president and CEO of Schaller Anderson, an Aetna company, and former president and CEO of Mercy Health Plans in Janesville, WI. Kelly is now CEO of HealthSmart, a healthcare consulting group based in Irving, TX.

DOJ Investigation Into Health Plan Mergers May Veer from Familiar

The DOJ also is known for being more responsive to public sentiment and media attention than other regulatory bodies such as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Kelly says. Though the mergers were filed initially with the FTC, it is the DOJ that will analyze the proposals for potential anti-trust violations.

Threshold for Trouble

 ""The DOJ is more argumentative in an overall sense than FTC,"" Kelly says. ""But that won't be a surprise to these companies. They knew that going in and they're preparing for that challenge.""

Participation in the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' Medicare Advantage plan will require close scrutiny by the DOJ, he says. In past merger investigations, the threshold for trouble was 40% market share and anything more than that would not be approved.

""My guess is there are will be some markets where more than 40% of the Medicare Advantage business is in the combined business,"" Kelly says. ""They likely will require the companies to sell membership in those places to get below that mark.""

A new area of concern that didn't exist for mergers even a few years ago is the impact on state exchanges, he notes. DOJ analysts will look at how the mergers would affect the quality and amount of insurance products available on the exchanges.

State attorneys general also are likely to join the process, Kelly says.

FTC and DOJ May Spoil Mega-Mergers Among Payers

""They're going to be looking for something different from the DOJ,"" he says. ""For example, Anthem has been talking in the press about abandoning some of the exchange markets. If I were a state attorney general, I'd be looking for a promise that they're not going to do that. It's not something that fits necessarily in an anti-trust complaint, but it's certainly an issue that might be on the table."""
1726,"America’s Cup racing syndicates Artemis Racing and SoftBank Team Japan will be among next month’s Argo Group Gold Cup fleet.

Artemis Racing, who have just hosted the Louis Vuitton America’s Cup World Series in Gothenburg, are making their second straight appearance in the Gold Cup while Team Japan will debut in the World Match Racing Tour event.

The Gold Cup fleet will again feature some of the world’s elite match race sailors.

“We have all of the Tour Card Holders, two America’s Cup teams and the winner of the national championships, which are going to be held this month,” said Peter Shrubb, the rear commodore of the Royal Bermuda Yacht Club, who is in charge of international sailing events.

“We also have four others who are pretty highly ranked people on the match race circuit, so it’s going to be a really good line-up.”

Shrubb also confirmed that Johnie Berntsson, the two-times King Edward VII Gold Cup winner and champion, and Stena Sailing Team are back to defend their crown.

“Johnie is coming back which is excellent,” Shrubb said. “This is probably one of the strongest line-ups we have had in a long time so it’s going to be really good.”

Returning as Gold Cup commentator this year is Tucker Thompson, the television host and commentator of the America’s Cup.

Meanwhile, the Gold Cup, which runs from October 7 to 11, could be the last involving the International One Design racing sloop.

After the announcement of Aston Harald AB’s acquisition of the ISAF-sanctioned World Match Racing Tour in June, there has been a shift in emphasis towards high-performance M32 catamaran for next year’s championship.

The Stena Match Cup has already announced that it will be raced in new M32 multihulls and James Pleasance, the executive director of the World Match Racing Tour, has made clear his ambition to extend use of the M32 across more events on the series, including the Gold Cup.

“It’s only a matter of time before the M32s becomes the boat of the Tour,” Shrubb said. “Now whether we can get enough of them here when we have the Gold Cup next year is yet to be seen.

“I understand they are going to be sending eight or ten of them to the East Coast of the United States and if that happens, hopefully we will be able to get them down to Bermuda.

“The Deed of Gift [for the Gold Cup] does not specify a particular class of boat and in the past we have held it in a number of different types of boats, but mostly in the IODs.

An M32 catamaran, which are made of carbon fibre, will be on display at the Gold Cup. ”One of the boats is going to be sent down here as a demonstration boat so we can see exactly what it’s like and what it can do and whether it’s appropriate to sail in the harbour,” Shrubb said.

Former Gold Cup winner Taylor Canfield and US One are very familiar with the M32 catamaran.

Canfield leads the M32 Series in Europe, which welcomed past Gold Cup winner and five-times World Match Racing Tour champion Ian Williams among the ranks.

Williams has joined to gain more competitive experience of multihull racing before the new-look 2016 tour."
2546,"As we come to the end of another financial year end reporting season and await the deluge of impenetrable financial reports, we can only lament that another year has passed and an important reporting mechanism widely used in many international exchanges, is still not with us.

In Australia financial statement information continues to be provided to users in detailed and complex reports, that are not user friendly. These may now be provided electronically in pdf format, but the problem is that the data can’t be extracted electronically; accurately and efficiently. There is a solution which is passing us by.

I am talking about XBRL - which stands for eXtensible Business Reporting Language - and it represents a standardised form of electronic reporting by companies which facilitates the preparation and exchange of financial statement information.

The formats for the preparation of data are now well established and the International Accounting Standards Board publishes a taxonomy that reflects the requirements of International Accounting Standards which are in use in most countries around the world (http://www.ifrs.org/xbrl/ifrs-taxonomy/Pages/ifrs-taxonomy.aspx).

It is required in many countries and if Australia wants to be a financial centre it needs to catch up. In the US the Securities Exchange Commission has since 2011 required all public registrants to file XBRL information. This is no longer new or untried technology and there many companies providing services for the preparation and use of XBRL information.

What are the benefits of XBRL? At a very practical level XBRL is a relatively straight-forward format for sharing financial information. As it uses standardised formats, which financial reports already follow, it allows for software to be developed which extracts relevant information and presents it in formats that makes it more relevant, understandable and facilitates it use.

Importantly, XBRL can make annual reports more transparent and reduces the risk of important information being lost in the notes. Not surprisingly XBRL usage has been found to improve analyst forecast accuracy. Software using XBRL may be proprietary or publicly available for sale, and it may allow sophisticated analysis to be undertaken.

This is simply not possible at the moment as financial data is provided by various data aggregators who manually key data. This naturally limits the amount of data provided and there are potentially issues of accuracy. Requiring firms to provide XBRL information will reduce the cost of data collection and increase the ability for international investors who might otherwise overlook Australian firms.

Australia operates in a global economy and this is part of the membership price. There is evidence that the provision of XBRL information reduces the cost of capital, and this is most pronounced for small, high growth firms that likely have low analyst coverage. So, while the relative costs might be higher for small firms, the benefits might be relatively higher too.

Has there been progress with implementing XBRL? There have been a number of initiatives to bring XBRL to Australia and these envision widespread application, encompassing all companies rather than just listed companies and the provision of information to multiple government agencies, including the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and the Australian Taxation Office.

This level of ambition while on the face it desirable, has committed us to a long and tortuous negotiations about format rather than achieving outcomes in a timely manner.

Our immediate focus should probably just be on firms listed on the Australian Stock Exchange and including this requirement in their Listing Rules."

188,"WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) - Former U.S. central bank chief Alan Greenspan said Friday he was ""baffled"" by the intense focus surrounding deliberations over whether the Federal Reserve should hike rates by a quarter percentage point. In an interview on CNBC, Greenspan said growing entitlement spending is a much bigger concern than monetary policy. Entitlement spending has risen from 5% of gross domestic product in 1965 to 15% of GDP today, he said. This shift of resources has led to a drop in capital investment and subsequent weak productivity, leading to the stagnation we've seen since 2009, he said. ""That type of stagnation is not going to go away until we resolve this problem,"" he said."
2129,"PHILADELPHIA, PA, Aug. 18, 2015 -- Today, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced a settlement involving 16 companies that have agreed to stabilize and cap waste and contaminated soils at the Central Chemical Superfund site in the city of Hagerstown, Md., for more than $14.3 million. In addition, the companies will reimburse the Agency $945,000 for past and future costs related to its ongoing oversight of the cleanup.

The 16 companies include: Arkema Inc.; Bayer Cropscience, LP; FMC Corporation; Honeywell International, Inc.; Lebanon Seaboard Corporation; Montrose Chemical Corporation of California; Occidental Chemical Corporation; Olin Corporation; Rohm and Haas Company; Rhone-Poulenc; Shell Oil Company; Syngenta Crop Protection, LLC; The Chemours Company FC, LLC; Union Carbide Corporation; Wilmington Securities, Inc.; and 21st Century Fox America, Inc.

The EPA-approved cleanup plan for contaminated soils and waste at the Central Chemical site includes on-site solidification and stabilization of a former waste lagoon; excavation, consolidation and capping of contaminated soils; and installation of a groundwater treatment system. The Agency and companies are still investigating cleanup of contaminated groundwater at the site.

From the early 1930s until the mid-1980s, Central Chemical Corporation blended agricultural pesticides and fertilizers at its Hagerstown facility. The pesticide-blending operation involved mixing inert materials with pesticides manufactured elsewhere to produce commercial grade products. Contaminants found at the site include pesticides and heavy metals.

The proposed consent decree, of which the State of Maryland is a party along with EPA, is subject to a 30-day public comment period and court approval.

93,"Looking for a team that the experts really can't agree on? How about Hugh Freeze's squad in Oxford

One of the themes this year for the SEC, and the SEC West in particular, is how hard it is to figure out what's going to happen once the season kicks off. There are so many variables -- teams that disappointed or surprised in 2014 and could return to form in 2015, squads that are clearly improving, major coordinators moves in some spots -- that we just don't know what to expect.

One of the more intriguing teams this year is Ole Miss. The preseason consensus around the Rebels appears to be that there is no consensus. Depending on to whom you listen, Ole Miss could end up anywhere from second to sixth in the SEC West and there would be multiple people able to say, ""I told you so."" That might not be the most confounding outcome this season, but it's pretty close.

 My first thought when I saw the injury to Laquon Treadwell in the Auburn game was that it looked unfortunately close to the career-ending injury suffered by Alabama's Tyrone Prothro in 2005. At the time, Treadwell was having a great year, grabbing 48 receptions for 632 yards and five touchdowns. And he might have been hitting his prime, with four catches for 71 yards against LSU and 10 receptions for 103 yards before going down against Auburn. Treadwell could be a bit more consistent -- with the exception of the LSU game, he either broke 100 yards or had 55 yards or less in every game last year -- but the fact that he's even planning to take the field is kind of remarkable. With a new quarterback to break in, a reliable target like Treadwell could make the adjustment process easier.

Actually, if you look at the standard deviation -- which is a way to measure how widely distributed a set of numbers is from their average -- Ole Miss is the third most confusing team in the SEC, behind only Auburn and Texas A&M. Both of those teams have different reasons for being ahead of Ole Miss, but Auburn ranks as highly as it does because of a sizable contingent of selectors tracked by Stassen who think that the Tigers are going to come in sixth this year. Taking those voters out would defeat the whole purpose of doing a standard deviation, but there's more consensus around the Tigers than you'll see at first glance.

But Ole Miss is distinct from Auburn and Texas A&M in another way: It is one of only two teams that has multiple selections at five different places in the Stassen roundup. At least two selectors in each case peg the Rebels at anywhere from second place to sixth in the division. Arkansas is the only other team with a similar spread if you get rid of what are essentially outliers. For all intents and purposes, Ole Miss is one of the more unpredictable teams in the conference this year. (And that doesn't even account for David putting the Rebels in Atlanta.)

Why Ole Miss? There are a couple of reasons that could explain the spread. For one thing, the Rebels are coming off their best season in terms of their record since 2009, were at one point ranked near the top of the polls and played in their biggest bowl game in a long time. Combine that with the fact that the Rebels beat just one FBS team after Oct. 18 and got crushed, 42-3, in their bowl game, and those who cherish a team's momentum are likely to push them down lower.

And there was the until recently (and perhaps still) unsettled situation at quarterback. And while Chad Kelly appears to have already surpassed Bo Wallace in alleged threats to use an assault weapon, it's a tall order to replace Wallace on the field. The good doctor was 229-of-381 passing for 3,194 yards, 22 touchdowns and 14 interceptions in 2014.

Finally, Bo Wallace is not the only player even casual SEC fans might recognize who won't be on the sidlines this year. Senquez Golson and his 10 interceptions -- yes, 10 -- are gone. Deterrian Shackelford, Serderius Bryant and Cody Prewitt have also moved on from the defense.

But there's a lot of talent returning to Oxford as well. All but one letterman on the offensive line is back -- though some starting roles have changed, at least for the UT Martin game. To the delight of just about everyone capable of human emotion, Laquon Treadwell returns to play wide receiver after an injury late in 2014 derailed a great season. Six more of the top eight Ole Miss pass-catchers join him. Jaylen Walton is sill there at running back. Marquis Haynes, who led the team with 7.5 sacks in his freshman year, and the Rebels' top two tacklers in Mike Hilton and Tony Conner are back on defense. Despite the bold-type names that Ole Miss is losing, it counts itself as returning 18 starters and losing seven. That's a pretty good ratio.

So look at the personnel losses and the late-season slide and wonder if Hugh Freeze can do it all again. But don't sleep on Ole Miss this season. There's more than enough left for another run at Atlanta.

The perfect season: The Ole Miss offense doesn't skip a beat with Chad Kelly at the helm, and Laquon Treadwell goes off, easily passing 1,000 receiving yards for the season and finding his name on a lot of finalists lists when awards season rolls around. The Rebels defense doesn't lose a step despite the personnel losses. Asking Ole Miss to beat revenge-minded Nick Saban might be too much, but the team is 7-1 when it heads to Auburn for a game that could decide the SEC West title. A win there would likely put the Rebels at 11-1 and could send them to the Georgia Dome with the chance at a national title on the line.

The nightmare: Kelly isn't impressive in his first few outings, and Ole Miss fails to keep things close in Tuscaloosa. Hugh Freeze watches as a full-blown quarterback controversy ensues. Meanwhile, the defense isn't quite as good with the losses its suffered. A second defeat at Florida begins to usher the Rebels out of the division race. Ole Miss wins just one or two of its last five games, dropping them to 7-5 or even 6-6.

What actually happens: The more you look at this team, the more you have to at least give it a credible chance of winning the SEC West. As far as the schedule, the draw out of the East isn't terrible, though it would be better if the Rebels traveled to Vanderbilt and faced Florida in Oxford, rather than vice versa. The one thing that could make things challenging for Ole Miss is that the Alabama and Auburn games are on the road, as is the Egg Bowl -- a rivalry that has seen the home team win 14 of the last 16 games. That could mean the difference between a trip to Atlanta for the SEC Championship Game and a trip to a less glamorous location in the postseason."

564,"New Delhi: A cyclical recovery is under way for the Indian economy, and the country's GDP growth is expected to improve to 7.8 per cent this fiscal from 7.3 per cent in 2014-15, a Nomura report says.



 According to the Japanese brokerage firm, the PMI data for August reinforce the view that cyclical recovery is in progress for the Indian economy led by improving consumption demand and rising profit margins owing to low inflation and falling interest rates.



 The Nikkei India Manufacturing PMI -- a composite monthly indicator of manufacturing performance -- stood at 52.3 in August, down from a six-month high of 52.7 in July.



 According to Nomura, historically, the manufacturing PMI has fallen in August and the decline this year has been much smaller than the average fall of 1 point in the last six years.



 ""Therefore, we believe that the PMI data signal improving manufacturing activity,"" it said.



 ""We expect a gradual recovery in GDP growth to 7.8 per cent in FY16 from 7.3 per cent in FY15, led by higher corporate profits, policy easing, debottlenecking of stalled projects and rising discretionary demand.""



 On RBI's policy stance, the report said the central bank is likely to cut its repo rate by 25 bps at its review later this month, following which it's ""likely to be on hold"".



 ""With CPI inflation likely to undershoot the Reserve Bank's 6 per cent inflation target for January 2016 and pipeline price pressures remaining weak, we expect RBI to cut its repo rate by 25 bps on September 29 and then go on hold,"" Nomura economists Sonal Varma and Neha Saraf said in a research note.



 RBI, which has lowered the benchmark rate by a combined 75 basis points so far this year in three instalments, is scheduled to hold its next bi-monthly monetary policy meet on September 29."
1972,"A Naperville businessman was sentenced Thursday to seven years in federal prison and ordered to pay more than $3.3 million in restitution, for conning clients into investing in nonexistent Turkish bonds as part of an elaborate, $28 million Ponzi scheme, authorities said.

John T. Burns III spoke for an hour in his defense before being sentenced by Judge Charles P. Kocoras in U.S. District Court in downtown Chicago.

Burns, 56, at the time of the scam lived on the 2000 block of Sable Oaks Drive, in the White Eagle Club area of Naperville. He was an owner and operator of USA Retirement Management Services, according to a release from the office of Zachary T. Fardon, U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Illinois.

The release said Burns persuaded a dozen clients to invest more than $3.3 million in Turkish bonds ""on the promise of lucrative returns."" He told the investors – many of them retirees – ""that he had substantial experience investing money on behalf of clients; that he and his parents were personally invested in the bonds; and that the profitable returns in those investments were providing financial security to him and his family,"" the release read in part.

""In reality, Burns was a mortgage salesman with no professional investment experience, and his family hadn't invested in the Turkish bond program because it didn't exist,"" the release declared.

""You were a good salesman, and they bought it,"" Kocoras said before imposing Burns' prison term. The judge also ordered Burns to make $3.38 million restitution to his victims.

A jury in November convicted Burns of two counts of wire fraud and three of mail fraud. His scam was part of a larger, Ponzi-type scheme involving the two other principal members of USA Retirement Management Services: Robert C. Pribilski, 57, of Lisle, and Mahmut E. Durmaz, 45, a former resident of Streamwood and Los Angeles now believed to be in hiding in Turkey, according to the release,

The three men bilked a total of 120 people of $28 million, according to a federal grand jury indictment.

Trial evidence showed Burns identified potential investors via seminars in Illinois and California. He sent out mass-mailings using postcards ""that promoted his presentation and offered a free meal to attendees,"" according to the release.

""Burns then used the seminars to schedule follow-up interviews with prospective clients, during which he pitched what he claimed was a uniquely profitable investment opportunity in the Turkish bonds. What Burns didn't tell the clients is that the Turkish bonds didn't exist, and that their investments were being used to pay other investors in a Ponzi-type scheme.""

USA Retirement Management Services had offices in Oakbrook Terrace and southern California. It was ordered out of business in 2010 by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

""Despite having no prior experience in estate planning or handling investments for clients, (Burns) held himself out as an experienced, certified estate planner,"" to gain access to financial records and pitch the scam to his clients, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Ryan S. Hedges, who prosecuted the case with partner Matthew F. Madden. Burns' ""motive to lie was greed, pure and simple.""

Pribilski pleaded guilty in April 2014 to one count of wire fraud, and is tentatively scheduled to be sentenced Sept. 29 in Kocoras' courtroom. Authorities are continuing their hunt for Durmaz, who fled the country in 2010.

The investigation of Burns, Pribilski and Durmaz came under the umbrella of the Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force, which includes representatives of federal agencies, regulatory authorities, inspectors general, and state and local law enforcement, the release indicated. ""The task force is working to investigate and prosecute significant financial crimes, and to combat discrimination in the lending and financial markets."""

1422,"Fluctuating oil prices has been a trend of recent years. Radio Sputnik International observer Dmitry Babich, who paid a visit to the video studio of Pravda.Ru, said that the ongoing drop in world prices on oil was contrary to both economic and political laws. According to our guest, the current state of affairs in global economy is strange, to say the least.

""The trend of the current year is the volatility of oil prices. Are we entering the time of unpleasant surprises and shocks?""

""I think we are entering the period when all trends are unexpected. In fact, no one knows how the situation will develop. Economists do not know what will happen. Market fluctuations reflect human emotions and expectations - they are just as volatile and unpredictable as the weather?

""When another economic system is created, in which it will be possible to make predictions, it will be the time when economic science starts working. In today's economic system in the world, one can not either plan or predict anything.""

""All this is, basically, a speculative market. Oil trade and the whole economy is based on futures - the sale of future contracts.""

""Everything is based on expectations of economic growth or recession - it's either expectations of prosperity or belt-tightening. People make mistakes, they rush in different directions, and markets and politics remain volatile.

""Who would have believed it in 2012-2013 if they were told that there would be a war in Ukraine with the use of tanks, artillery and rockets? The current unpredictable actions of Western players in the political market complements the unpredictability of economic markets. Today, it is impossible to make reasonable qualified forecasts.

""Many compare the current situation to the late 1980s, when Saudi Arabia dumped oil prices to ten dollars per barrel. Nowadays, it is not only Saudi Arabia, but also the United States that is dumping oil. They conspired to break Russia up, as they did in the past to the Soviet Union. Do you think such a theory can be reasonable?""

""This theory has existed for many years, but there are many gaps in it. In 1991, the Soviet Union was not supposed to collapse, because 1991 was the time of the war in the Persian Gulf. Everybody was expecting a disaster as the straits that lead into the Persian Gulf were likely to be blocked. Oil prices were supposed to skyrocket, and the Soviet Union was supposed to survive, because in 1991, the USSR would have received a powerful doping of petrodollars. Yet, it did not happen.

The collapse of the Soviet Union was not the result of low prices, it was not the matter of economy or the dumping of Saudi Arabia and the United States. They could only support the trends that were already happening on the market. In 1991, the US government was even afraid of the collapse of the USSR. No one knew how the situation would be developing. The US elite used to be less adventurous than it is now.

""I think that there were more fundamental issues that Saudi Arabia and the United States could support at some point. The current decline in oil prices is somewhat unnatural. Oil prices rise during the times of war. This, for example, was very noticeable after the US invasion of Iraq. Nowadays, there are at least three major conflicts going on, but oil prices are falling - this is unnatural.""

""Can oil prices fall down to the level of ten dollars per barrel?""

""They surely can, but no one can predict that. I am convinced that the Ukrainian crisis had not been planned. I think that the European Union and the United States, when they supported the Ukrainian opposition, they wanted to put pressure on Yanukovych, to push him towards making the decisions that they wanted him to make. They could not predict either his fall or the conflict that it would trigger in the Ukrainian society.

""The first Maidan did not start a civil war in Ukraine. The second one did. They could not predict Russia's actions in the Crimea either. Today, the levers of influence on world politics and economy are in the hands of not very educated people. Most importantly, these people bear no responsibility for their actions.

""The United States admitted that the invasion of Iraq in 2003 was a mistake. The States lost 4,000 soldiers, thousands others were crippled.The Americans had spent a few trillion dollars on that war, but no one went to jail, no one was even demoted. These are nothing but lies in millions of kilobytes. And no one is responsible.

If someone in the USA says that we need to listen to what Putin says, that person will be immediately fired. It is only Henry Kissinger, who can say such things in the US. Such people as Kissinger or Stephen Cohen have nothing to lose.""

""Lower oils prices affect the Russian economy. What may happen in the near future? What lessons should we learn from this crisis?""

""Lessons can be learned even from the Soviet crisis. It was much more painful than the current crisis. If someone tells me that life in today's Russia is bad, it would mean that this person did not live in the Soviet Union in late 1980s and in early 1990s. The Soviet Union was living under sanctions for some thirty, forty, if not fifty years. The USSR was not flexible.

""Today, the West is a lot more aggressive against Russia than it was during the times of the Soviet Union. Yet, the West has not broken Russia, because we have market economy.

2162,"In a recent article published on Forbes, Data Journalist Niall McCarthy looks into patent disputes in the United States, concluding that the country is set to see a record number of patent disputes this year.

According to a report issued by Unified Patents, projections suggest 2015 will witness more than 7,000 patent disputes, with litigation cases reaching at least 6,100, and PTAB cases, more than 1,900. This figure compares to 5,002 litigation cases registered last year, and 1,677 PTAB cases, and would be the highest ever in the country.

From a sectorial standpoint, tech companies faced the most litigation related to intellectual property infringements. As it can be seen in the chart below, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) leads the bunch with 35 patent litigation cases started against it in the first half of the year.

Samsung Electronics (OTC: SSNLF) and Hewlett-Packard Company (NYSE: HPQ) trail the tech behemoth , but are not far behind. The companies were sued 33 and 32 times, respectively, between January and June.

Outside of the tech segment, Actavis was the most sued, with 25 cases over patents.

650,"Filing for and being awarded unemployment insurance can be a stressful, time consuming and demanding task. The information in this article will make filing and winning a claim for unemployment insurance benefits less stressful. If you suddenly find yourself unemployed, you should seek unemployment insurance benefits immediately.

You are late for work one morning due to a traffic jam on the highway. When you finally arrive, your supervisor informs you that you no longer have a job. Your employment has been terminated but your bills still have to be paid. Fortunately, you may be entitled to benefits administered by your state government. These benefits are called unemployment insurance benefits. They provide monetary payments for a specified period of time to workers who become unemployed through no fault of their own.

Unemployment insurance benefits are provided by the states within the guidelines of federal law.  Eligibility is determined by the states.

People often have the misconception that they are not eligible for unemployment benefits. This is a major mistake. Most do not realize how complex the decisions the division for unemployment insurance benefits are required to make on each claim for benefits. When it comes to dealing with state governments, do not assume anything. When you find yourself unemployed, regardless of the reason, you should file a claim for benefits. You may be awarded benefits when you think it is impossible. If you follow the guidelines in this document, your chances for obtaining unemployment benefits will be greatly improved.

The first and most important thing to do is to begin the process immediately after your employment has ended (permanently or temporarily). Do not try to file beforehand but do not wait. Generally, it takes two to three weeks to receive a benefits check after filing.

You should contact your local unemployment office.  Most states now offer the option to file online.  If you are not sure where your local unemployment office is located, or would like to file a claim online, visit the US Department of Labor Website http://www.ows.doleta.gov/unemploy and click on state service centers.  Please note that not all states will allow you to file online at this time. When filing a claim, you should have the following information available:

The benefits officer will ask for all of the above information. If you have this accurate and readily available, the process will go much smoother. After the general information, you will be asked why you are no longer or temporarily unemployed. Do not give false information. However, do not provide more information than what they ask.

If you were discharged for any reason, the officer will ask if you have been warned in the past or were made aware of company rules regarding their policy on that particular offense. This is a critical question. It may be the question that determines whether or not you will receive benefits.  If you were discharged for circumstances within your control but were not made aware of the rules of your Company or did not receive prior warnings in accordance with Company standards, there is a good chance you will be awarded benefits.

So, if you were discharged for violating a rule that you were not made aware of or had not received prior warnings in accordance with Company standards, be sure to tell the officer this. In addition, if you were treated differently than other employees regarding the rule you violated, be sure to inform the officer. Do not go into great detail at this point, but merely say, “I was treated more harshly than other employees who have violated the same rule.” In doing this, you are trying to establish your credibility and put the credibility of the company in question.

Do not use the word “fired.”  It is a harsh word.  If you were fired because you were late, say “I was discharged for being tardy due to circumstances beyond my control.” In other words, do not provide false information, but be careful with the wording you use. After the officer finishes, thank them for taking your information. Ask them how long it will take to make a decision on your claim. At this point, it is a waiting game.

The unemployment division will now send a fact finding questionnaire to your past employer. This questionnaire will ask the employer identical questions that you were asked. The employer has a timeline in which they must answer the questions. If the employer does not respond in a timely manner, the unemployment officer should award benefits to you. This is why it is important to file a claim even if you think it is impossible for you to gain benefits. Oftentimes, companies are extremely busy and understaffed. So, responding to an unemployment claim may be low on their priority list.

If they fail to respond, the benefits officer for the unemployment division will be forced to make a decision based only on the information you provide. That is why wording is so important. If the employer responds in a timely manner, the officer will make their decision based on the facts of the case. Once a decision is made, the officer will mail the decision to you and the employer. If you are not awarded benefits, do not be discouraged.  You have the right to an appeal.

Filing for unemployment insurance benefits is similar to filing for social security disability benefits in that you are often denied benefits on your initial attempt. Be sure to file an appeal immediately. You have a timeline to file the appeal. Do not exceed this timeline. You will be asked why you are appealing the decision. This is your chance to “lay everything on the table.” If there are any inconsistencies in rules adminstered by your employer, explain them thoroughly. If you quit your job because you were physically unable to perform the job and your employer would not accommodate you, go into detail with your illness and the job duties required.

For example, if you were discharged for poor job performance (low production) you could say, “I have been employed by ABC, Inc. for two years. During this time, I accomplished many tasks for my employer. I took pride in my job. However, I was not properly informed of the production standards. My production rate was equal to many other employees in my department. Nevertheless, I was singled out for low production. I only received one formal warning (if in fact you did only receive 1 warning). The Company has a progressive discipline plan and it was not followed in my case. Others have received numerous warnings, yet, they still work for the Company. Therefore, due to the lack of established production standards, inconsistent disciplinary rules among various employees, and the Company’s inability to properly warn me, I feel that I should be awarded benefits.  Thank you for your time and understanding.”

Focus on why you deserve benefits and why you feel you were not treated fairly. Be sure you have your facts correct. Do not state that you have one (1) warning and the Company proves there are two (2) warnings. You are trying to establish credibility. Therefore, you need to be sure the things you say are accurate. After you submit your appeal (remember to submit on time), the Company will be contacted for an appeals hearing. This will involve you, the Company, and an Unemployment Insurance Review Officer. The appeals hearing may be over the phone or may be at your local Unemployment Insurance Benefits Office.

Whatever the case, do not be late! You will be asked similar questions you have responded to in writing. You should have all of your previous documents available so you can respond quickly and accurately. In addition, if there are witnesses who can help your case, have them with you. Once you have been questioned, the employer will now be questioned. Do not interrupt. You will have a chance to ask the employer questions at the end. If you have pertinent questions, ask away. However, if you were able to discuss your case and the employer was not able to disprove anything you said, it is better to not ask the employer questions. In the end, the officer will inform you that a decision will be made and mailed to each of you.

This information is provided as a guide for filing and winning a claim for unemployment benefits. However, it does not serve as a guarantee that you will be awarded benefits or that the process will unfold in exactly the same way in your state. After reading this document, if you have further questions or would like assistance in completing questionnaires, etc. please contact me."
2081,"7-Eleven is being investigated over allegations of wage theft that have seen its network of convenience stores described as operating “a sweatshop on every corner”, and fresh claims have emerged that the alleged scam went all the way to senior management.

Fairfax Media this morning revealed it was in possession of thousands of leaked documents that allegedly implicate 7-Eleven’s head office in the scandal.

The documents contain extracts of interviews conducted by 7-Eleven’s field inspectors, in a payroll compliance review of 225 franchises across the country, which allegedly found that the vast majority were underpaying staff. The alleged breaches of workplace laws were handled internally.

The company stands accused of paying workers as little as $10 an hour, with a Fairfax Media analysis revealing that up to two-thirds of stores are blatantly ripping off staff. That’s less than half the award rate of more than $24 an hour, and you can forget about overtime or penalty rates.

In what is being dubbed the “half-pay scam”, staff are allegedly paid for only half the hours they work, with time sheets fudged and “ghost workers” added to rosters before franchisees send the paperwork to head office.

The former head of Australia’s competition watchdog Allan Fels this morning said he found it hard to believe that 7-Eleven’s head office did not know what its franchisees were up to.

“It’s just impossible to believe that they’re unaware of it,” Prof Fels said on ABC radio.

The company responded to the wage theft allegations over the weekend, posting a statement on its website which said it was “extremely disappointed that a number of franchisees have chosen not to meet their obligations as employers” and encouraged workers to seek help from the Fair Work Ombudsman.

The Ombudsman announced this morning that it had launched fresh legal proceedings against a 7-Eleven retail store in Sydney which allegedly underpaid two migrant employees almost $50,000 and falsified their paperwork.

Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James said the decision was made to prosecute because of the seriousness of the alleged breaches and the involvement of vulnerable migrant employees.

In response to tweets from outraged customers, the United States 7-Eleven account tweeted overnight:

@BeachMilk We are confident 7-Eleven Australia will take the appropriate steps to address this situation. http://t.co/kN2H7HVQVI — 7-Eleven (@7eleven) August 30, 2015

One worker told Fairfax of his harrowing time working at a 7-Eleven in the Gold Coast area, recounting a nightmarish routine of working 16-hour shifts.

One Indian student told the publication there was no sympathy from his bosses, even after he was violently robbed twice in the space of 18 hours.

The store manager allegedly chastised the student for not fighting back against the balaclava-clad man who, armed with a long, serrated knife, robbed him of $180.

“Ah should fight or do throw the till on him, something, punch him. Why did you give the money like?” the manager is claimed to have said.

The student said he was made to foot the bill if drive-off petrol thieves struck on his shift, and perform the jobs of two people in running the store on his own.

International students can find themselves in a difficult situation if franchisees underpay them, because employers can wield the threat of dobbing them into immigration authorities for breaches of their visas — even if the breach, such as working extra hours, has been imposed by the employer.

There are also allegations that franchisees have withheld passports and drivers licences of staff.

Earlier this month, a 7-Eleven franchisee was fined $21,000 for underpaying an overseas worker and refusing to co-operate with the Fair Work Ombudsman.

The franchisee ripped off a Nepalese student $21,298 over the 13 months to last February while operating a Queensland outlet, which has since been closed.

Initially fined $6970 by the Federal Circuit Court, defied orders to produce documents and pay the student the wages he was owed, prompting the heftier fine.

More court cases can be expected as the scandal unfolds, with Fair Work analysing evidence seized in raids across Australia.

7-Eleven is owned by billionaire businessman Russell Withers and his family, who brought the American franchise to our shores in the 1970s.

A spokeswoman for the company said in a statement to Fairfax: “7-Eleven strongly supports the Fair Work Ombudsman’s investigation into employees’ pay and conditions currently underway at a select number of franchisees’ stores ... In the one instance we were made aware of a store employee’s passport being held by a franchisee, we intervened to facilitate the return of the passport.”

The spokeswoman said 7-Eleven expected franchisees to meet their legal obligations and that if even one store was underpaying workers, it was one store “too many”.

A statement posted on 7-Eleven’s website said: “We take our responsibility as a franchisor seriously. We ensure we provide education and support to assist our franchisees to meet all their legal obligations, including their obligations as the employers of store staff.

“We are deeply concerned about the personal impact on affected employees or former employees, and the damage such actions cause to franchisees who are trusted, reliable and responsible small business owners, meeting their obligations as employers. Our business does not condone the action of any franchisee who does not meet their employer obligations, and we do not and will not hesitate to take any appropriate action, under law and within the franchise agreement, where a franchisee is found to be in contravention of the law.

“If you have any questions or concerns about your pay or conditions, we would encourage you to contact the Fair Work Ombudsman for advice and support.”

1403,"Russian oil giant Rosneft has reported a sharp drop in profits due to lower oil prices.

Net income between April and June was 134bn roubles ($2bn; £1.3bn), down 22% compared with a year earlier. Revenue was 1.3tn roubles.

Despite the drop, the results were better than analysts had expected.

In the second quarter last year, the price of oil was more than $100 a barrel, while this year it ranged between $55-$65.

The weak rouble helped to offset lower prices - Rosneft sells its oil in dollars, so a weak currency means the price of oil in roubles rises.

Despite the sharp fall in the oil price, the company maintained its production levels during the quarter, producing an average 5.2 million barrels a day.

The first six months of this year, the company said, ""was characterised by high fluctuation of oil price and exchange rate, increased transportation tariffs and tax burden, [and] high interest expenses due to [a] change in interest base rate""."
986,"Even the greatest idea ever conceived meant little until it became a reality. Transforming these ideas into a functional business requires hard work, commitment, passion, and, of course, a great deal of capital.

Despite being a vital component of any company in its infancy, accumulating capital is an area most founders lack experience in. As the founder of your business, your main focus is building your company, not fundraising. Right?

Not necessarily. Without proper funding, you risk more than economic stability for your company. You risk momentum.

Fortunately, we live in a time where you have more options than ever to fund your young company. Among those options are the more traditional avenues such as a loan from a bank or family member. However, a newer, more contemporary approach has gained popularity and success in recent years: equity crowdfunding.

Equity crowdfunding (what’s sometimes referred to as investment crowdfunding) is a way for investors to invest in a company and gain either ownership, or a promise of future returns. Rewards-based crowdfunding, on the other hand (common to sites such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo), provides investors with certain kickbacks or rewards for contributing.

Since its inception, equity crowdfunding has proven to be a powerful marketing, fundraising and engagement tool in line with contemporary technologies, behaviors, and investors’ mindset.

Indiegogo Cofounder Danae Ringelmann is quoted as saying; “We don’t see crowdfunding and venture capital as mutually exclusive.”

There is certainly truth in this statement. In fact, crowdfunding can help pave the way toward landing a highly engaged venture capitalist down the line, which is why so many startups are choosing this funding channel. That’s because with crowdfunding, you’re given the opportunity to sell your idea direct to the consuming public.

The success of your crowdfunding campaign can help future investors assess the demand for the product in the marketplace, thus removing some of the risk involved in their investment. In other words, a successful crowdfunding campaign is likely to make your company more attractive to investors in the future, as you seek further funding.

However, the benefits of equity crowdfunding go beyond the world of startups. This modern approach to funding a company offers much more than more traditional methods possibly can. Take, for example, the ability to tell a story, procure growth funding or even finance an acquisition. The possibilities are much more broad and deep than many outside the industry have given credit.

As you look to raise funds for your company, you’ll likely create a variety of marketing materials, such as videos, downloadable documents (financial projections, for example) and more.

In this age of instant access and mobile-friendly viewing, it’s vital that you make it easy for potential investors to gain access to your “story” without committing too much time or effort in the process.

The traditional approach to raising funds no longer gels with modern-day business, where computer screens outnumber reams of paper. Nobody wants to be inundated with packets, folders, or even emails. They want to have one site where they can access information and learn whether your idea is worth investing in.

Enter crowdfunding, where rather than create endless amounts of costly kits and packets that are often ignored, you’ll simply compile your materials into one, user-friendly crowdfunding page.

Better yet, as your campaign grows and evolves, so too can your crowdfunding page. Making changes to a web page is vastly superior to having to reprint a press kit.

Before the JOBS Act was enacted, startup founders could not discuss raising capital with complete strangers. This severely limited whom you could solicit. While that might have been a viable approach before the Internet, today it’s grossly outdated.

Luckily, times have changed. By choosing to raise capital through equity crowdfunding, entrepreneurs can pitch their ideas to a growing number of accredited investors without committing the time and cost to traveling.

All startup companies need three types of people on board:

In the past, these three groups of people were mutually exclusive. That proved to be cumbersome and prohibitive. You’d approach a bank or family member solely for the funding, and then would spend hours convincing hordes of friends and neighbors to evangelize on your behalf. Finally, you’d schedule a separate and large chunk of time into developing a market strategy designed to identify and capture your customers.

Three separate projects eating up valuable time and resources.

With equity crowdfunding, however, the lines have blurred. Investors become supporters. Supporters become customers. Your contributors want to see your business succeed, so they actively market on your behalf.

Everyone’s on the same team all focused on the game goal.  And your crowdfunding page is the scoreboard, keeping track of your successes; serving as a platform that encourages excitement and anticipation.

The business of business is constantly evolving. Technologies, cultural shifts, and innovative concepts redefine how we create, run, and grow our companies.

While crowdfunding has long been an avenue of choice for companies looking to offer rewards for investments, it’s also proven to be a worthwhile tool for equity investments."

2280,"RICHMOND, Va. — The feds got what they wanted out of HDL. Now they’re going after the former face of the embattled blood testing firm.

Tonya Mallory, the co-founder and former CEO of downtown-based Health Diagnostic Laboratory was sued Friday by the United States, which alleges that her involvement in a massive kickback scheme caused the federal government to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in improper reimbursements from Medicare and Tricare.

Three whistleblower cases filed several years ago in South Carolina led to a federal investigation, which spurred Friday’s 48-page lawsuit that names Mallory and four other defendants.

Also named as defendants in the suit are BlueWave Healthcare Consultants, HDL’s former third-party sales contractor; BlueWave’s co-founders Floyd Calhoun Dent and Robert Bradford Johnson; and Berkeley Heartlab, which had employed Mallory, Dent and Johnson before the three founded their respective companies.

The government’s case centers on kickback payments – which the defendants called process and handling fees – paid to physicians by HDL, California lab company Singulex and Berkeley Heartlab to encourage them to use those labs’ services. The government claims those payments violate the False Claims Act and anti-kickback statutes.

The lawsuit alleges that the defendants between them paid $80 million in “improper” process and handling fees to doctors. That resulted in false claims to government healthcare programs that ultimately sent back $500 million in reimbursements to HDL, Singulex and Berkeley, according to the lawsuit.

The government claims that BlueWave paid physicians $68 million in kickbacks on behalf of Mallory and HDL between 2010 and 2014.

And between 2009 and 2014, HDL collected $333 million from Medicare and Tricare, the two federal programs mentioned in the case.

HDL and Singulex were not named as defendants in the case. They each entered into settlements with the federal government earlier this year to resolve a similar kickback inquiry. HDL agreed to pay $47 million as part of that settlement.

The allegations could force Mallory to pay millions of dollars in civil penalties and are the latest chapter in the HDL saga, in which the once fast-growing company and all-star of the Richmond startup scene became a bankrupt firm on the verge of being sold off in an auction.

Mallory, a VCU grad, founded HDL in 2008 after leaving Berkeley. The company became a sudden success story that, publicly, was built on the benefits its blood tests offered in predicting ailments like heart disease and diabetes."
705,"In Oakland and cities across the Bay Area, outdated municipal policies require developers to spend a significant amount of money constructing large parking garages in new apartment buildings — a mandate that ultimately makes it harder for projects to include affordable housing. The problem — outlined in our recent cover story, "" A Green Solution to Oakland's Housing Crisis "" — is that decades-old, car-oriented zoning laws require developers to waste money and land on unnecessarily large car garages, which can lead them to pass the costs along to tenants and build less affordable housing.But Assembly Bill 744 — which passed the state Senate this week and is now at the desk of Governor Jerry Brown — could help address this problem by allowing affordable housing developers to bypass certain parking requirements. Supporters hope the legislation could help cities increase their supply of housing for middle- and low-income renters while also promoting sustainable modes of transportation. Advocates say reduced parking in projects located near public transit could support greener lifestyles by encouraging residents to live without cars — and making their housing more affordable. Current parking requirements vary across cities and can change from one neighborhood to the next. For decades, Oakland has had a fairly standard policy of requiring one parking space per unit in most of its new developments — a ratio that advocates say no longer makes sense in the busy downtown corridor near BART (where apartment buildings can easily attract car-free tenants). AB 744 — introduced by Ed Chau, D–Monterey Park — would prohibit cities from requiring projects to build more than 0.5 spaces per unit if the developments are offering 100 percent affordable rental units and are located within one-half mile of a major transit stop. In other words, if a developer wanted to do an affordable housing project near BART in Oakland, he or she could build a garage half the size of what is typically required in the city, saving a substantial amount of money and space. In many cases, it would not be financially feasible to build an exclusively affordable housing project if a developer also has to build a conventional, large-size garage.(Under current Oakland rules, developers can build less parking than the one-space per unit requirement, but they have to request a special exemption through a public process — and few projects have historically taken advantage of this on a large scale).AB 744 also would allow certain mixed-income projects near transit to bypass parking requirements. Under the legislation, projects within one-half mile of a major transit stop and withaffordable housing could go as low as 0.5 parking spaces per(meaning a building with primarily two-bedroom units would still have roughly one parking space per unit). These projects, however, would only be eligible to reduce their parking to that level if they have at least 20 percent units for low-income people (or at least 11 percent units for residents categorized as ""very low-income""). You can read the full text of the bill here and the latest fact sheet summarizing the bill here Complex ratios and parking formulas aside, the crux of the bill is that when developers want to build less parking and more affordable housing in projects near transit, cities should not stop them. That's why Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf expressed her support for the bill back in June. In a letter endorsing the bill, she wrote:Under the current system, Schaaf further noted in her letter, ""one-size-fits-all"" parking standards essentially force low-income residents who do not own cars to bear the burden of parking costs for everyone else. She referenced a letter from a labor union in Minnesota that supported a similar local measure there by arguing that low-income transit riders who can't afford cars are paying increased housing costs to make their buildings more convenient for car owners. You can read Schaaf's full letter here Despite Schaaf's support of the bill and ongoing efforts by the City of Oakland to reform its own parking policies, the city is still receiving and approving residential development proposals near BART with huge amounts of car parking. Transportation advocates have recently criticized two proposed projects right next to the 19th Street BART station — one on Broadway and 19th Street and another on San Pablo Avenue and 18th Street . Critics say they both include an excessive amount of parking for a transit-accessible district such as Uptown."

782,"They make for some of the most enticing headlines in financial media. They often get choice real estate on the pages of The Wall Street Journal, and the juicier ones have excited pundits barking about them on CNBC:

""Wonky Widgets Stock Going Through the Roof in IPO""

Why the prominence, and why the frothing excitement? What exactly is an IPO, anyway?

Taking stock

""IPO"" stands for ""initial public offering."" That three-word combination nicely boils down the root concept -- a company offers shares of its stock to the general investing community for the first time.

Essentially, the company offers a part of itself to investors like you or me -- hence the term ""going public"" -- via one of the stock exchanges. These days in America, this is pretty much a two-horse race between Intercontinental Exchange's (NYSE:ICE) New York Stock Exchange, and Nasdaq OMX Group's (NASDAQ:NDAQ) Nasdaq.

The company unloads a certain number of shares representing a portion of the overall ownership stake through the chosen market. The company uses its net sales from that issue to fund investments, retire debt, enrich founding shareholders, and/or employ any number of other uses a big pile of money can be put to.

Privately held companies have one big disadvantage, in that their options to raise significant capital are very limited. Most businesses don't generate enough free cash flow to rapidly fund ambitious expansion plans.

Its only other real alternatives are to draw in more investors, or take out some form of debt financing such as bank loans. But sugar-daddy investors are rare, first of all, and second, they typically demand a big chunk of the business in return for their investment.

A capital-hungry enterprise can borrow money -- assuming it can find a lender willing to shell out the full amount needed -- but of course, debt has to be repaid, with interest and within a certain time frame.

In contrast, selling shares raises capital that doesn't have to be paid back, plus it can easily be done while retaining a controlling stake. It's also fast. When engineered successfully and well, an IPO can raise the necessary funds in a relative hurry -- one typically takes around three to four months to organize and launch.

Shared burden

So we should all incorporate, rush to the trading floor of the NYSE to announce we're a public company, and then watch the money barrel on in!

Not so fast. Every exchange has a set of criteria for companies coming to market, and the bar's set pretty high.

Nasdaq mandates that its stocks have a minimum of 1.25 million shares upon listing, a minimum per-share price (usually $4), and three market makers -- brokers who guarantee they'll always buy or sell the stock -- behind it. And that's just for a start; there are a host of other guidelines.

That's why stock market offerings, for the most part, are comparatively large, even for companies that are hardly gigantic. For example, gym chain Planet Fitness issued 13.5 million shares in its IPO floated earlier this summer.

No matter how diligent and dedicated an enterprise, the chances are it doesn't have the wherewithal to sell millions and millions of shares. That's where underwriters come in.

These are financial professionals -- more often than not, the investment banking arms of big financials such as JPMorgan Chase or Citigroup -- that basically act as the salespeople for the IPO.

They divvy up those millions of shares (either by taking them on their own books at an agreed price, or simply brokering them), and attempt to sell them in the IPO. The underwriters take a set of fees for their work and are usually allotted shares in the issuing company.

IPOh, no

So everybody wins, yes? The business raises money, the founders become obscenely rich, and the public gets a cool new company in which to own stock. What could possibly be the downside?

Well, there are many. A publicly traded company is obligated to reveal its finances, in great detail, to the public. And that's just one set of a host of rules the stock's exchange mandates to maintain the listing. There are accounting rules, trading rules, corporate governance rules, and on and on. The list is very long, and it's not easy or cheap to comply with.

So an IPO is definitely not for every business. An enterprise that doesn't need gobs of capital for expansion (such as your local mom-and-pop sandwich store) probably doesn't need to go public. Likewise, a business that has managed to grow large on its own, with a relatively small group of shareholders at the helm, also might not find it necessary.

IPOs had been coming at us thick and fast thanks to the sustained bull market of recent times -- for obvious reasons, it's best to sell new shares in an atmosphere of optimism and hope (investors are being asked to buy shares of a business that is unproven on the market, after all). That's why, with the recent volatility, we're now witnessing an abrupt halt to IPO activity.

But it'll come back sooner or later. After all, there's a lot of investor money out there, and more than enough ambitious, capital-hungry businesses eager to go after it."
2547,"Mainstay Medical International plc (“Mainstay” or the “Company” listed on Euronext Paris: MSTY.PA and ESM of the Irish Stock Exchange: MSTY.IE), a medical device company focused on bringing to market ReActiv8®, a new implantable neurostimulation system to treat disabling Chronic Low Back Pain (“CLBP”), today announced the publication of its report for the half year ended 30 June 2015.

Mainstay is a medical device company which is developing an innovative implantable neurostimulation system, ReActiv8®, for people with disabling Chronic Low Back Pain (CLBP). The Company is headquartered in Dublin, Ireland. It has subsidiaries operating in Ireland, the United States and Australia, and is listed on Euronext Paris (MSTY.PA) and the ESM of the Irish Stock Exchange (MSTY.IE).

The ReActiv8-A Clinical Trial, is a prospective single arm clinical trial with up to 96 subjects at sites in Australia and Europe. Outcome measures for the ReActiv8-A Clinical Trial are assessed at a three month endpoint after activation of stimulation and compared to baseline prior to implant. Further details can be obtained at https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01985230.

One of the recognised root causes of CLBP is impaired control by the nervous system of the muscles that dynamically stabilise the spine in the lower back, and an unstable spine can lead to back pain. ReActiv8 is designed to electrically stimulate the nerves responsible for contracting these muscles and thereby help to restore muscle control and improve dynamic spine stability, allowing the body to recover from CLBP.

People with CLBP usually have a greatly reduced quality of life and score significantly higher on scales for pain, disability, depression, anxiety and sleep disorders. Their pain and disability can persist despite the best available medical treatments, and only a small percentage of cases result from an identified pathological condition or anatomical defect that may be correctable with spine surgery. Their ability to work or be productive is seriously affected by the condition and the resulting days lost from work, disability benefits and health resource utilisation put a significant burden on individuals, families, communities, industry and governments.

Further information can be found at www.mainstay-medical.com

ReActiv8 is an investigational device and is not approved for commercialisation anywhere in the world.

CAUTION – in the United States, ReActiv8 is limited by federal law to investigational use only.

We are pleased to report on the progress of Mainstay Medical International plc (“Mainstay” or the “Company”) and present the half year report of the Company and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) for the half year ended 30 June 2015.

Mainstay is a medical device company focused on bringing to market ReActiv8®, a new implantable neurostimulation system to treat disabling Chronic Low Back Pain (“CLBP”).

The Company is incorporated and registered in Ireland as a public limited company. The Company together with its operating subsidiaries Mainstay Medical Limited, MML US, Inc. and Mainstay Medical (Australia) Pty. Limited form the Mainstay Medical Group.

ReActiv8-A trial - On 31 August 2015, the Company announced positive clinical results of the ReActiv8-A Clinical Trial, which the Company plans to use to support its submission for CE Mark approval, after which commercialization in Europe can commence. The detailed Clinical Results announcement is available on the Company’s website at http://www.mainstay-medical.com/news/press_releases.

US clinical trial and regulatory process - In January 2015, the Company submitted an application to the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for approval to start a clinical trial of ReActiv8 under an Investigational Device Exemption (“IDE”).

In May 2015, Mainstay announced it had received approval from the FDA to begin a clinical trial of ReActiv8 under an IDE. The FDA approval is for the planned ReActiv8-B Clinical Trial, an international, multi-centre, prospective randomized sham-controlled trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ReActiv8 for the treatment of adults with CLBP and no prior back surgery.

The approval is to conduct the ReActiv8-B Clinical Trial at up to 40 clinical trial sites and for 128 randomized subjects to be implanted with ReActiv8 in the pivotal cohort. The IDE approval allows the Company to engage with investigators, clinical trial sites, and Institutional Review Boards (“IRBs” or “Ethics Committees”) leading towards the first subject recruitment and implant. Upon successful completion of the ReActiv8-B Clinical Trial and if the results support it, the Company plans to submit an application for a Pre-Market Approval (“PMA”) which is required to allow the start of commercialisation in the United States.

In the approval letter, the FDA provided some helpful study design recommendations and the Company is engaging with the FDA in relation to these comments.

US Patent Filing - In July and August 2015, Mainstay announced the issuance of three new U.S. Patents:

Income statement – Mainstay is at a pre-revenue stage. Operating expenses related to on-going activities were $6.3 million during the period ended 30 June 2015 (30 June 2014: $4.8 million before exceptional items). On-going activities include clinical and regulatory activities, research and development, and general and administrative expenses.

Research and development expenses reflect costs incurred for research, design and development of the Group’s product ReActiv8. Research and development expenses were $1.2 million during the period ended 30 June 2015 (30 June 2014: $1.2 million). Clinical and regulatory expenses relate to the ongoing ReActiv8-A Clinical Trial and regulatory activities. Clinical and regulatory expenses were $2.3 million during the period ended 30 June 2015 (30 June 2014: $1.7 million). Non-cash expense in relation to share options for the period ended 30 June 2015 was $0.8 million increased from $0.2 million for the period ended 30 June 2014 due to the increase in the Company’s share price with the IPO.

Statement of financial position – Cash on hand at 30 June 2015 was $12.5 million (31 December 2014: $18.3 million). Operating cash out flows for the period ended 30 June 2015 were $5.7 million (30 June 2014: $6.2 million). Total assets of the Group were $13.2 million (31 December 2014: $18.8 million).

On 24 August 2015, Mainstay announced the closing of debt financing for up to $15 million. The secured debt facility is non-dilutive to existing shareholders, and is being provided by IPF Partners, a leading financing provider focused on the European healthcare sector.

The facility can be drawn in three tranches, and an initial tranche of $4.5 million has been called. The second and third tranches can be drawn upon achievement of milestones related to progress through the CE Mark process for ReActiv8.

The principal risks and uncertainties faced by the Group for the remaining six months of 2015 remain substantially unchanged from the disclosures included in the 2014 Annual Report. Those risks and uncertainties should be read in conjunction with this report and the Company’s press releases and other public disclosures (copies of which can be found on the Company’s website).

Mainstay looks forward to continuing to work towards obtaining CE Mark and commencing commercialization in Europe.

The Group has incurred losses of $67.9 million to date (includes the losses of Mainstay Medical Limited and MML, US Inc. incurred prior to the incorporation of Mainstay Medical International plc and includes losses attributable to the Company’s 2014 Corporate Reorganisation). As at 30 June 2015, the Group reported shareholders’ equity of $11.4 million and cash of $12.5 million. As detailed in the Financial Review above the Group is at a pre-revenue stage in the development of ReActiv8 and expects to incur further losses in the medium term. Progress on the development of ReActiv8 is detailed in the Business Review and the Company’s press release in respect of results of the ReActiv8-A Clinical Trial released on 31 August 2015.

To fund the further development of ReActiv8 the Group has raised debt and equity and it continues to explore funding strategies (e.g.: equity, debt, partnering) to support the Group’s activities into the future. The Group is carefully monitoring its cash flows and has the ability to consider alternative strategies and budgets to ensure that the Group will have sufficient funds to be able to meet its liabilities as they fall due for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of these Interim Financial Statements.

Accordingly the Directors believe it is appropriate that these Interim Financial Statements are prepared on the going concern basis.

The condensed Interim Financial Statements have not been reviewed by the Company’s auditors.

Notes to the condensed consolidated Financial Statements

Mainstay Medical International plc is a company incorporated and registered in Ireland. Details of the registered office, the officers and advisers to the Company are presented on the Corporate and Shareholder Information page.

The half year report and Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements (“the Interim Financial Statements”) in this report for the six month period ended 30 June 2015 comprise the results of the Company and of its subsidiaries (together the “Group”). At 30 June 2015, the Group comprises the Company and its operating subsidiaries Mainstay Medical Limited, MML US, Inc. and Mainstay Medical (Australia) Pty. Limited.

The Company shares are quoted on Euronext Paris and ESM of the Irish Stock Exchange.

Mainstay is a medical device company focused on bringing to market ReActiv8®, a new implantable neurostimulation system to treat disabling Chronic Low Back Pain (“CLBP”).

The Interim Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the EU. They do not include all the information and disclosures necessary for a complete set of IFRS Financial Statements. However, selected explanatory notes are included to explain events and transactions that are significant to an understanding of the changes in the Group’s financial position and performance since the last annual consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2014.

The Interim Financial Statements have been prepared applying the accounting policies that were applied in the preparation of the Group’s published consolidated financial information for the year ended 31 December 2014 prepared in accordance with IFRS, as adopted by the EU and available from the Company’s website (www.mainstay-medical.com).

The comparative information provided in the Interim Financial Statements relating to the periods ended 30 June 2014 and 31 December 2014 does not comprise the statutory financial statements of the Group. Those statutory financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014 on which the auditors gave an unqualified audit opinion, have been delivered to the Registrar of Companies.

In addition, the following new standards were adopted by the Company for the first time in the current accounting period: Through the Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2011-2013 Cycle, the amendments to IFRS 3, IFRS 13 and IAS 40. None of these had a material impact on the Group’s financial results.

There are no significant or material changes to judgements or estimates used in these Interim Financial Statements versus those used in the full Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2014.

The Interim Financial Statements were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 31 August 2015.

The Group has incurred losses of $67.9 million to date (including the losses of Mainstay Medical Limited and MML, US Inc. incurred prior to the incorporation of Mainstay Medical International plc). As at 30 June 2015, the Group reported shareholders’ equity of $11.4 million and cash of $12.5 million. As detailed in the Interim Management Report the Group is at a pre-revenue stage in the development of ReActiv8 and expects to incur further losses in the medium term. Progress on the development of ReActiv8 is detailed in the Interim Management Report and the Company’s press release in respect of results of the ReActiv8-A Clinical Trial released on 31 August 2015.

To fund the further development of ReActiv8 the Group has raised debt and equity and it continues to explore funding strategies (e.g.: equity, debt, partnering) to support the Group’s activities into the future. The Group is carefully monitoring its cash flows and has the ability to consider alternative strategies and budgets to ensure that the Group will have sufficient funds to be able to meet its liabilities as they fall due for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of these Interim Financial Statements.

Accordingly the Directors believe it is appropriate that these Interim Financial Statements are prepared on the going concern basis.

The Financial Statements are presented in US Dollars (“$”), which is the functional and presentational currency of the Company. Balances in the Financial Statements are rounded to the neared thousand (“$’000”) except where otherwise indicated.

The introduction of Mainstay Medical International plc as the new parent company in the Group during 2014 was accounted for as a continuation of Mainstay Medical Limited’s business. Consequently the comparative financial information presented represents that of the Group headed by Mainstay Medical Limited for the period from 1 January 2014 to 2 April 2014 and of the Group headed by the Company for the period from 3 April 2014 to 30 June 2014 and for the period from 1 January 2015 to 30 June 2015. Further information is provided in Note 3 below.

This note provides information on the Corporate Reorganisation which occurred during the 6 month period to 30 June 2014.

On 3 April 2014, the Company acquired all outstanding ordinary and preference shares in Mainstay Medical Limited in exchange for issuing 793,425 series A shares, 1,967,177 series B shares, 500,000 series Z shares and 81,400 ordinary shares to former shareholders in Mainstay Medical Limited, in each case on the basis of one share in the Company in place of 20 shares of the same class in Mainstay Medical Limited.

Both prior to and subsequent to the 2014 Corporate Reorganisation no individual shareholder or party had control of the Group. As the 2014 Corporate Reorganisation effectively changed the parent company of the Group from a legal perspective only, no business combination in accordance with IFRS 3 was deemed to have occurred.

As IFRS 3 Business Combinations did not apply to the 2014 Corporate Reorganisation, the Company, as referred by IAS 8, used guidance set by other standard-setting bodies and adopted merger accounting treatment. As a result, the Company accounted for the introduction of Mainstay Medical International plc as a continuation of the business of Mainstay Medical Limited. Consequently, even though the Company was not incorporated until 17 February 2014 and did not become a Group company until 3 April 2014, the disclosures in the Financial Statements include the consolidated financial statements of Mainstay Medical Limited prior to the date of the 2014 Corporate Reorganisation.

In addition, in accordance with the provisions of section 149(5) of the Companies Acts 1963, the Directors determined that the pre-acquisition losses of subsidiaries should be transferred to a reorganisation reserve on consolidation in the Group accounts.

As a result, in the consolidated financial statements of the Group, the difference between the carrying amount of preference shares and other equity items, including retained losses previously held by Mainstay Medical Limited and MML US, Inc, and the fair value of the shares issued by the Company is reflected in the Statement of Changes in Equity where it is recorded in the reorganisation reserve.

The impact of the above on the reorganisation reserve was a transfer of $34,030,000 from retained losses, representing the accumulated losses of Mainstay Medical Limited and MML US, Inc at 3 April 2014, and a fair value increase in ordinary shares in issue of $934,000, resulting in a total transfer to the reorganisation reserve of $34,964,000. This classification within a reorganisation reserve in the Group’s consolidated financial statements does not impact on the distributable reserves of any individual subsidiary. See note 11 for further information.

Due to the nature of the Group’s current activities, the Company considers there to be one operating segment, active implantable medical devices (AIMDs). The results of the Group are reported on a consolidated basis to the Chief Operating Decision Maker of the Group, the Chief Executive Officer. There are no reconciling items between the Group’s reported condensed consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income and statement of financial position and the results of the AIMDs segment.

The Group has operations in Europe, the US and Australia. The non-current assets held in these jurisdictions are detailed below:

For the period ended 30 June 2015 there are no matters presented as exceptional.

For the period ended 30 June 2014, the Directors presented the following matters as exceptional as they relate to matters arising as a result of the Company’s IPO on 2 May 2014.

On 3 April 2014, pursuant to the 2014 Company Reorganisation (refer to note 3) the Company acquired all outstanding ordinary and preference shares in Mainstay Medical Limited. The preference shares having equivalent rights in Mainstay Medical Limited had been classified as non-current liabilities and derivative financial instruments in the statement of financial position of the Group at 31 December 2013. Immediately prior to the reorganisation, a fair value expense adjustment of $17,193,978 was recorded in Mainstay Medical Limited’s statement of profit or loss representing the difference between the carrying value at 31 December 2013 and the carrying value at 3 April 2014. There was a corresponding change in the derivative liability.

Immediately prior to completion of the IPO, all issued Series A, Series B and Series Z preference shares in the Company converted on a one-for-one basis into ordinary shares of €0.001 in the Company. Prior to the conversion of the preference shares in the Company to ordinary shares, a fair value adjustment was recorded in the statement of profit or loss of $49,273,644 representing the difference between the carrying value at 3 April 2014 and the fair value as at 28 April 2014. There was a corresponding change in the derivative liability.

On conversion of the preference shares to ordinary shares, the debt and derivative components of the preference shares were then derecognised from the statement of financial position as the Company’s liability had been settled. The fair value of the preference shares as at 28 April 2014 was allocated to share premium and capital conversion reserve based on the carrying value of the preference shares pre and post the acquisition of these shares by the Company on 3 April 2014.

The combined impact of the above events resulted in a total fair value expense adjustment of $66,467,622 recorded in the Group statement of profit or loss. Following conversion of all preference shares during the period to 30 June 2014, the Company will not incur such fair value movements through the statement of profit or loss in future periods in relation to these preference shares.

Expenses directly associated with the Company listing its existing shares on the ESM and Euronext Paris of $4,039,681 were charged directly to profit or loss during the period ended 30 June 2014.

The adjustment for initial public offering and reserves related expenses of $3,003,000 in the cash flow statement includes these IPO expenses and the impact of the 2014 Corporate Reorganisation expenses (accounted for in share premium). In the Half Year report published on 28 August 2014, the impact of the 2014 Corporate Reorganisation expenses was included in the movement in prepayments and other receivables.

Earnings/ losses per share are calculated by dividing net loss attributable to equity holders for the period by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. As the Group is incurring operating losses, there is no difference between the basic and the diluted earnings per share.

The weighted average number of ordinary shares for the period ended 30 June 2015 (denominator) amounted to 4,294,141 (30 June 2014: 1,553,957, the weighted average during this period reflects the number of ordinary shares in issue pre and post the Company’s IPO). There are no adjustments between reported profit or loss from continuing operations and earnings used for the purposes of earnings per share.

The loss per share before exceptional items for the period ended 30 June 2015 was $1.48 (30 June 2014: $3.54). The loss per share for the period ended 30 June 2015 after exceptional items was $1.48 (30 June 2014: $48.85).

Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior period are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the relevant taxation authorities. The tax charge has been prepared based on the Group’s best estimate of the weighted average tax rate that is expected for the full financial year. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those used in Ireland, the United States and Australia.

Certain companies within the Group provide services on a “cost plus” basis to other group companies, and consequently generate profits that are subject to corporation tax in the United States and Australia.

Tax receivable was classified within prepayments and other receivables as at 31 December 2014. The Company has included this disclosure on to a separate line in the Balance Sheet in the current report.

On 2 December 2011, Silicon Valley Bank provided the Group with a loan of $2,000,000 with a fixed annual interest rate of 10% to be serviced by interest-only payments until 1 July 2012, followed by monthly principal and interest payments until 1 December 2014. The bank loan was repaid in full on 7 March 2014.

In connection with these borrowings, MML issued immediately exercisable warrants to purchase up to 13,000 shares at $7.70 per share with an expiration date of 2 December 2021. The fair value of these warrants on the date of issue was $69,000.

The Company’s ordinary shares are quoted in Euro and have been translated into US Dollars at the rates ruling at the date of transactions. On 2 May 2014, the Company listed its ordinary shares on the ESM of the Irish Stock Exchange and on 5 May 2014, the Company listed its ordinary shares on the Euronext Paris. As at 5 May 2014, the issued share capital of the Company consisted of 4,294,141 ordinary shares of €0.001 each (which carry voting rights) and 40,000 deferred shares of €1.00 each (which do not carry voting rights, are not entitled to receive any dividend or distribution and have in effect no right to a return of capital on a winding up).

At the Company’s 2015 AGM on 18 June 2015, the authorised share capital of the Company was increased from €50,000 divided into 10,000,000 ordinary shares of €0.001 each and 40,000 deferred shares of €1.00 each, to €60,000 divided into 20,000,000 ordinary shares of €0.001 each and 40,000 deferred shares of €1.00 each following the passing of Resolution 4, set out in the Company’s 2015 Notice of AGM.

At the Company’s 2015 AGM held on 18 June 2015:

The Directors in their absolute discretion and without assigning any reason therefor may decline to register any transfer of a deferred share. The Company is authorized at any time to appoint any person to execute on behalf of the holder(s) of deferred shares a transfer thereof and/or an agreement to transfer the same, without making any payment to the holder(s) thereof and persons so entitled, to such person(s) as the Company may determine as holder(s) thereof and beneficially entitled thereto.

Series A, Series B and Series Z shares were classified as non-current liabilities and derivative financial instruments as at 1 January 2014. Immediately prior to the Company’s IPO, all Series A, Series B, and Series Z preference shares converted on a one-for-one basis into ordinary shares of €0.001 each in the Company.

The reorganisation reserve represents (i) fair value differences arising as a result of group restructurings in 2012 and 2014; and (ii) the pre-acquisition historical losses of subsidiaries at the date of the 2012 and 2014 restructurings. This classification within a reorganisation reserve in the Group’s consolidated financial statements does not impact on the distributable reserves of any individual subsidiary. All pre-acquisition losses of individual subsidiaries will need to be offset by sufficient subsequent distributable profits before subsidiaries will be in a position to make distributions.

The capital conversion reserve represents fair value uplifts in preference shares between issue and conversion. This reserve is not distributable.

The Group’s financial risk management strategy is described in the annual Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2014. There have been no changes to the risk management procedures or policies since the 2014 year end.

As at 30 June 2015 the Group’s only financial instruments were trade payables and cash which can be settled within 30 days. The fair value of these items is equivalent to their carrying value in accordance with IFRS 13.

The Group’s only exposure to significant credit risk relates to cash on deposit. The Group maintained its cash balances with its principal financial institutions throughout the period. The Group’s principal financial institutions carry investment grade rating.

The Group’s reporting currency is the US Dollar. The Group’s exposure to foreign currency risk arises through expenditure incurred in Euro and Australian Dollars. The Group’s Australian subsidiary has an AUD functional currency. The translation differences on the Australian subsidiary are not material.

The Group did not have material asset or liability amounts in foreign currencies at 30 June 2015 other than €18,000 and AUD$5,800 held in cash. A strengthening (or weakening) of the US Dollar against Euro of 5 per cent would have (decreased)/ increased the loss for the period by $1,000 (30 June 2014: $35,000). Any reasonable or likely movement between the US Dollar and the Australian Dollar are considered not likely to have a material impact on the Group’s statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.

The Group’s cash balances are maintained in short term access accounts and carry a floating rate of interest. A 50bps change in the rate of interest would not have had a material impact on the Group’s statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income in the period.

The Group operates an employee share option plan (the “Plan”). As at 30 June 2015, the Plan allows for the Company to grant various classes of share options to employees of the Group companies, Directors, consultants and other contractors. As at 30 June 2015, 533,020 share options over ordinary shares of the Company have been granted under the Plan.

The Plan allows for flexibility in the grant conditions of each individual option, including variations on the amounts of options granted, the vesting requirements for each option and the expiration terms of the options.

Details of share options granted as at 30 June 2015.

Total non-cash expense charged to profit and loss in relation to share options for the period ended 30 June 2015 was $814,000 (30 June 2014: $232,000).

No share options have expired unexercised or have been exercised during the period ended 30 June 2015. No share options have been forfeited during the period ended 30 June 2015. The above options all include service vesting conditions and vest over periods ranging from one to four years.

Options granted prior to 2013 have an exercise price of $0.80. Options granted in 2013 have an exercise price of $1.00. Options granted in 2014 have exercise prices of either $1.00 or in the range of €14.90 to €18.51. Options granted in 2015 have exercise prices of €14.90.

The value of services received in return for the share options granted to employees and non-employees was based on the fair value of the options granted, measured using a Black-Scholes model with the following inputs:

During the period to 30 June 2015, the Group purchased services of $33,364 (30 June 2014: $36,527) from Orsco Life Sciences AG, a company controlled by Oern Stuge MD, a Director of Mainstay.

There were no balances outstanding to/from Orsco Life Sciences AG as at 30 June 2015 (31 December 2014: Nil).

The Group defines key management as its executive Directors, non-executive Directors and senior management. Details of remuneration for key management personnel are provided below:

As referred to in the Interim Management Report, on 24 August 2015 Mainstay announced the closing of debt financing for up to $15 million. The secured debt facility is non-dilutive to existing shareholders, and is being provided by IPF Partners, a leading financing provider focused on the European healthcare sector.

The facility can be drawn in three tranches, and an initial tranche of $4.5 million has been called. The second and third tranches can be drawn upon achievement of milestones related to progress through the CE Mark process for ReActiv8."

670,"The insurance sector has been hiring all year and appears on track to continue to add personnel.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the unemployment rate for the finance and insurance industry was at 2.1 percent in July, down from 2.4 percent in June.

Employment in financial activities rose by 17,000 in July and has risen by 156,000 over the past 12 months. Insurance carriers accounted for more than half of the gain in July (+10,000) and over the year (+85,000), according to BLS.

The insurance sector unemployment rate compares with a rate of 5.3 percent for all non-farm sectors.

Also, according to a survey by The Jacobson Group and Ward Group, 65 percent of property/casualty  insurance companies polled have plans to continue adding personnel, even while expecting a slowdown in business.

If the industry follows through on its plans, there will be a 1.98 percent increase in industry employment within the next year, according to the Semi-Annual U.S. Insurance Labor Outlook Study.

“The survey results show revenue growth predictions dropping to their lowest rate in three years,” says Gregory P. Jacobson, co-chief executive officer of Jacobson, the insurance recruiting firm. “Despite this drop, staffing predictions are at their second highest rate since the economic downturn. The industry is clearly focused on filling positions and growing staff.”

Technology, claims and underwriting positions continue to be the most in demand industry positions, according to the study.

The Jacobson-Ward study found that while growth predictions are down, nearly 79 percent of organizations still expect an increase in revenue throughout the upcoming year."
461,"When China devalued its currency in mid-August after a 10-year run-up against the dollar, the People’s Bank of China described the move as a natural step toward the creation of a market dominated Chinese exchange rate. No one in the market — not importers, exporters, manufacturers, investors or analysts — bought the message. Global stocks and commodity markets sold off at an astonishing rate, triggered by fears that China could launch a prolonged currency war that would boost its own exports at the expense of those it buys from, including the U.S."
1113,"Last month, HousingWire reported that Green Tree’s days were numbered, after Green Tree’s parent company, Walter Investment Management Corp. (WAC), announced quietly that it planned to merge Green Tree with another of Walter Investment’s well-known subsidiaries, Ditech Mortgage Corp, to form a new company, ditech, a Walter company.

Walter Investment announced Wednesday that the merger is now complete.

The full legal name of the company will be Ditech Financial LLC, but the company will operate as ditech, a Walter company.

The merger was actually announced in February when Walter Investment released its full-year results for 2014, but the merger is now complete.

As of Tuesday, visitors to Green Tree’s website, greentreeservicing.com, were automatically redirected to ditech.com.

In February, Mark O’Brien, Walter Investment’s chairman and chief executive officer, said the move to merge the two companies was being made to “drive efficiencies” within the company.

“By consolidating our Green Tree and Ditech brands under the name ‘Ditech, a Walter Company’ and enhancing focus on the use of technology, we will drive efficiencies through the reduction of duplicative functions and cost structures and become a stronger, more unified end-to-end mortgage company,” O’Brien said in February.

With the merger now complete, Walter Investments’ origination and servicing businesses now operate under the ditech umbrella.

“We believe the completion of our customer-focused originations and servicing integration under the Ditech brand will simplify many processes, improving the quality of our customers' experience as they do business with us, as well as drive operational efficiencies,” O’Brien said Wednesday in release announcing the completion of the merger.

Ditech will be led by co-presidents, Patti Cook, who will serve as president of Ditech Originations and David Schneider, who will serve as president of Ditech Servicing.

Walter Investment also said in February that the merger of Green Tree and ditech will help the company’s bottom line.

The company said that additional cost-savings of “at least $35 million have been identified with approximately $25 million expected to be realized in 2015 related to capturing opportunities for enhanced benefits from shared services, the consolidation of Green Tree Servicing and Ditech in the second half 2015 and a significant acceleration of automation efforts which will increase efficiencies company-wide.”

By divesting itself of the Green Tree name, Walter Investment leaves behind Green Tree’s legacy, which included a $63 million fine by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Federal Trade Commission for “mistreating borrowers” by failing to honor modifications for loans transferred from other servicers, demanding payments before providing loss mitigation options, delaying decisions on short sales, and harassing and threatening overdue borrowers.

“Green Tree failed consumers who were struggling by prioritizing collecting payments over helping homeowners,” CFPB Director Richard Cordray said at the time. “When homeowners in distress had their mortgages transferred to Green Tree, their previous foreclosure relief plans were not maintained. We are holding Green Tree accountable for its unlawful conduct.”

Green Tree said at the time that it agreed to the terms of the settlement, ""without admitting or denying any allegations.""

O’Brien said the settlement was in the best interest of Green Tree, its consumers, its clients and its shareholders.

“As a company, we have been and continue to be committed to properly serving homeowners and helping them remain in their homes,” O’Brien said in April. “We continue to develop and deploy best practices in our servicing operations and believe these standards will serve us well as we partner with our consumers to support them in their goal to achieve sustainable homeownership.”

But now, Green Tree is no more."
1599,"According to the Box Office report by the National Film and Video Foundation, the top three local films were Ballade vir 'n Enkeling, Mooirivier and Strikdas.

Film director Sara Blecher, who has worked on Otelo Burning, Surfing Soweto and the upcoming release Ayanda, said the success of Afrikaans-language films could be attributed to filmmakers who had been ""developing a consistent vision to uplifting their films"".

""The Afrikaans market is a small margin compared to other languages in this country, but they believe and support the enrichment and preservation of their culture and language.

""They get private funders who are also willing to keep the language strong.

""Filmmakers should all engage each other to unpack and learn from the Afrikaans market just where they could be going wrong and how they, too, can further their films,"" said Blecher.

The NFVF said that of eight local productions released between January and July this year, seven were Afrikaans and one was English.

A study by the foundation focusing on South African film-goers revealed that ""when it comes to indigenous language, audiences prefer Zulu as a language to watch films, followed by Afrikaans, Xhosa, Sepedi, Setswana and Sesotho"".

Actress Florence Masebe, who starred in Elelwani, said: ""Every culture likes watching films in their own languages and about their own cultures, but there are not enough cinemas.

""There are many other issues, including that funders need to also fund for the marketing and distribution of the film, not just the production aspect.

""Filmmakers shouldn't have to mortgage their homes and use their children's education funds to ensure their films are a success.""

1736,"I'm not normally a big gold Rolex kind of guy. But this watch? This watch is just straight up incredible.

Hopefully at this point in the summer you've been able to spend a little time outside the confines of the office and maybe you've got a bit of a tan. That means it's prime gold watch season. You won't catch me endorsing oversized blingy gold watches that come complete with diamonds and require strength training before you can wear them, but something like this well-worn Rolex GMT-Master is a perfect compromise between sober understatement and wristwatch bravado.

Rolex's gold sport watches are unique beasts. They have the same form factor as steel Submariners and GMT-Masters, just the material and color schemes are changed. So, even though they're made in precious metal, the silhouettes and styling don't feel overwrought. Rolex still makes them today, but the best vintage examples are from the 1970s and '80s, when the bracelets were a little slimmer and the cases not so brightly polished.

This particular watch is a GMT-Master in solid 18-karat gold, including the intricate gold Jubilee-style bracelet (usually found on Datejusts). The gold has taken on a warm hue over the decades, since the case has probably never been polished. The bevels on the lugs are some of the sharpest I've seen on any GMT; since gold is softer than steel, any soft polishing would obliterate these immediately. Impressive.

The dial on this watch is immaculate. It's faded from dark brown to a softer, more milk chocolate color, but all the thin gold markings look brand new. The markers are raised gold and filled with luminous material that perfectly matches the hands. Because of the shape of these markers, the style of dial is known by collectors as a ""nipple dial"" and is something only found on Rolex's gold sport watches. A gold date disc and faded mono-color bezel complete the look, making this about as un-flashy as a gold sport watch can be.

In general, when you think of a gold Rolex, what comes to mind is something dressy like a Day-Date or maybe even a Datejust. These watches are great, but this time of year I want a warm-toned sport watch sitting on my wrist. This one would do just fine.

This Rolex GMT is available from 10PastTen and is priced at $17,500."
324,"MADRID (Reuters) - Markets will be watching for China's next move as signs of a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy stack up, raising expectations it will act to stoke growth.

A looming snap election in Greece and a closely watched conference hosted by the Federal Reserve in the United States are also likely to keep investors on their toes next week, in particular as they look for hints on when the U.S. will raise interest rates.

Fears that Chinese growth is weakening, dragging down the global economy with it, are already hammering commodities and world stock markets.

Both tumbled on Friday after a survey showed Chinese manufacturing slowed the most since the global financial crisis in 2009 - adding to other worrying clues about the country's health, including its falling exports.

China devalued the yuan earlier in August, by pushing its official guidance rate down 2 percent. The central bank has said there was no reason for the currency to fall further, but investors are also bracing for further interest rate cuts.

""It will be all eyes on the Chinese authorities for any further policy support steps, alongside the People's Bank of China yuan fixings and trading swings,"" analysts at Investec Economics said in a note to clients.

China is also widely expected to relax reserve requirements ratios for its banks again in the coming months, a measure intended to spur lending by reducing the cash they need to hold. It is trying to keep its economy on course to grow 7 percent in 2015 - its slowest pace in a quarter of a century.

""We continue to expect a total of 100 basis points of reserve requirement ratio cuts by end-2015, with the first cut likely to take place within the next two weeks,"" economists at Standard Chartered said.

The cash reserves ratio has already been cut three times this year.

By the end of next week attention may shift away to the Rocky Mountains, where policymakers are due to gather from Aug. 27-29 for the Fed's conference of central bankers, finance ministers, academics and financial market participants in Jackson Hole.

Fed chair Janet Yellen is not expected to attend, raising the prospect that other Fed officials may be more tight-lipped about the likelihood of the first rate increase in almost a decade, some analysts said.

The prospect of an increase as soon as September receded this week as the Fed released minutes of July meeting. They gave no clear signals as to the timing of such a move - which would affect markets across the world and could cause more pain for emerging market assets, already being hit by China's woes.

Fed policymakers are still concerned about the weakness of the global economy, the minutes showed, but they were also more confident about US growth prospects.

Further clues on both matters should be gleaned from data releases this week, including second-quarter gross domestic product figures for the United States, due on Thursday.

Quarter-on-quarter GDP growth in the period is expected to be revised upwards to 3.2 percent from 2.3 percent, according to a Reuters poll.

In the euro zone, investors will also be looking at an German economic sentiment survey due on Tuesday for a better idea of the scope of the bloc's recovery.

Preliminary August consumer price readings for Germany and Spain on Friday will provide further insight into how effective the European Central Bank's bond-buying efforts have been at warding off deflation.

But the spotlight will mainly fall once again on Greece, where Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has resigned. That opened the way for early elections after he secured much-needed funds from the country's third international bailout program.

The current Greek government aims to strengthen its position in the election after accepting a rescue deal it once opposed. But that creates more uncertainty for markets already on edge over whether Greece will deliver on promised reforms and get its economy and banks back on track."

Which is just as well as Jessica Alba's The Honest Company is now under fire for not being quite as honest as they should be about the ingredients in their natural nontoxic products.

A customer has filed a class action lawsuit against the business, which makes an array of baby products including nappies to sunscreen, as well as household cleaners.

John D. Rubin claimed Honest actually sells items that contain unnatural ingredients, as well as other products which are ineffective.

He summed up his allegations in the first two words of his complaint saying: 'Honest isn't.'

Rubin was asking for reimbursement as he claimed customers were paying over and above the cost of other 'comparable products that did not purport to be natural.'

In the suit, according to Law360,  it was claimed Honest's hand soap, dish soap, diapers and multi-surface cleaner contained unnatural ingredients.

And it went on to say the company's sunscreen was ineffective, prompting customers to complain online about sunburn and blistering after using it.

Alba, and her co-founder Christopher Gavigan, did previously acknowledge there were some issues with the sunscreen in August.

It was announced they had reformulated it to improve the duration of its water resistance.

In a statement on their website it said: 'We’ve gone through extensive third-party testing in accordance with government regulations and our sunscreen lotion passed all SPF 30 testing requirements.

'It also received the best score possible from the Environmental Working Group.'

However Rubin is claiming breach of contract, violation of California's Consumer Legal Remedies Act, False Advertising Law and Unfair Competition Law, along with unjust enrichment.

The Honest Company was started in 2012 with 17 products and now has more than 120 items, which are sold at more than 4,000 retailers across the United States and Canada.

Alba recently revealed it was always 'part of the plan' to expand the company's range to cover beauty and skincare items as well as their parenting-oriented products.

She said: 'Beauty was always part of the plan. It was just a matter of when, how and being able to execute it properly. I didn't want to do this half-a**.'

Chief executive officer and fellow co-founder Brian Lee added: 'The size of the beauty market is much larger than the other categories we are claiming today, so does it have the potential to be larger than The Honest Company? Absolutely.'

The collection spans more than 80 individual items, with most part of the makeup range, although the beauty insists there is no one 'hero product'.

'There's no hero product; we tried to offer anything you could ever need,' she told Women's Wear Daily.

'If women like one product, they're likely to try more. I will always try something that a girlfriend tells me she loves, way more than watching a commercial about it.'

The company has an impressive headquarters in Santa Monica, which focuses on creating products without toxins such as petrochemicals and synthetic fragrances.

'We started the company with this mission of helping to create a nontoxic world,' Lee, told Business Insider.

'We strategically decided to go in baby and family first because we knew that was an area of awakening for a lot of mothers, like my own wife.'

1700,"Gold prices advanced to their highest level in more than a week on Tuesday after losses across global stocks and a pullback in the dollar burnished the metal’s allure as a haven.

The most actively traded contract, for December delivery, rose $7.30, or 0.6%, to settle at $1,139.80 a troy ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile..."
1732,"Gold futures settled at their highest level in more than two weeks on Tuesday, as a selloff in global stock markets and downbeat economic data helped boost the metal’s investment appeal.

Prices for the metal had posted declines in five of the last six sessions, as investors weighed prospects for a U.S. rate increase and on fears about China’s economic growth linger.

Gold futures for December delivery GCZ5, -0.39%  rose $7.30, or 0.6%, to settle at $1,139.80 an ounce on Comex. That was the highest settlement since Aug. 24.

China’s official manufacturing purchasing managers index fell to a three-month low, delivering a fresh blow to global markets that have spent August rattled by uncertainty about China’s economic health. The sharp decline in equities, in turn, lured more investors to the perceived safety of gold.

In the U.S., data showed that the final Markit PMI totaled 53.0 in August, down from 53.8 in July. Also, the Institute for Supply Management said its U.S. manufacturing index fell to 51.1% in August from 52.7% in July.

“On top of safe haven buying, gold is in a nice uptrend and moving into its strongest period of the year for physical demand with India wedding season approaching fast,” said Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at CMC Markets.

In August, gold logged its largest monthly gain since January as investors fretted about recent stock-market declines spurred by China worries. It saw a monthly gain of around 3.4%, which was the largest since January’s 8% surge.

But although turmoil in Beijing has been luring haven buyers into gold, the outlook for the metal may not be lustrous.

In a Tuesday research note, Barclays points to a number of bearish factors that could help cap upward moves in the yellow metal. It expects limited physical demand going forward and said the gold market is already factoring in shifting expectations about the timing of a Federal Reserve rate hike to sometime after September.

“We see limited support from physical fundamentals, and further support from U.S. rate expectations should also be limited, as the market is already pricing in a low probability of a September hike,” Barclays said.

On Comex, gold was among the few gainers as concerns surrounding demand put pressure on industrial metals.

December silver SIZ5, -0.86%  added 3.4 cents, or 0.2%, to end at $14.62 an ounce. But December copper HGZ5, -2.37%  ended at $2.302 a pound, down 3.6 cents, or 1.5%. October platinum PLV5, -1.37%  shed $2.10, or 0.2%, to $1,008.40 an ounce, while December palladium PAZ5, -0.65%  fell $23.05, or 3.8%, to $579.20 an ounce."
856,"There is good news for homeowners burdened beneath the weight of negative equity and not-so-good news for lenders trying to stay compliant with federal compliance requirements.

On the homeowner front, Zillow reports that the U.S. negative equity rate dropped below 15 percent in the second quarter. Zillow credited this decline on the least valuable one-third percentage of homes, which benefited from the rising level of home values.

“If the overall negative equity rate is going to continue to fall, it will need to keep being driven down by improving health at the bottom end of the market,” said Zillow Chief Economist Svenja Gudell. ""The least valuable homes really bore the brunt of negative equity during the recession, and that's where most negative equity remains concentrated today.”

But this is not to say that the negative equity crisis is ready for the history books: more than 15 million homeowners still carried this problem. Condo owners had it even worse: Nearly 20 percent of these property owners were still stuck with underwater mortgages. In fact, single-family homeowners were more likely to be underwater than condo owners in only three major markets—Detroit, Memphis and Pittsburgh.

Gudell added that an influx of new homebuyers could further push down the negative equity levels.

“As more first-time buyers enter the market seeking these less expensive homes, home value growth at the bottom end could continue to outpace growth overall, which will be good news for millions of underwater homeowners in these homes,” she said.

On the lender side, Burlingame, Calif.-based ComplianceEase analyzed a cross-section of 700,000 audits on closed loans with compliance defects in the first quarter and found that 17 percent of the loans failed for Truth in Lending Act (TILA) reasons while another six percent of failed for being outside of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA).

The analysis was based on a cross-section of 700,000 audits that were performed in ComplianceAnalyzer and RESPA Auditor during the first quarter of 2015. It found that 17 percent of the loans failed for Truth in Lending Act (TILA) reasons. Another six percent of the loans—or one in 15—failed for being outside of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) tolerances. If that’s not bad enough, 4.5 percent of Qualified Mortgage (QM) loans failed Safe Harbor tests and 11 percent of loans were incorrectly categorized as to their QM status.

ComplianceEase estimated that the average reimbursement was $328 for the RESPA-failed loans and $740 for all loans that had an uncured RESPA violation. These reimbursements will rise in the third quarter when the new TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure (TRID) rule takes effect.

“Based on our analysis, closing defects are already an expensive problem for lenders under the current rules, and are about to get riskier and more expensive under TRID,” said John Vong, president of ComplianceEase. “Lenders and settlement service providers will need to work together so they can produce higher quality loans and not add to the already high costs of origination.”"

1691,"Gold futures settled lower on Wednesday, for their sixth loss in eight sessions, as upbeat U.S. economic data provided a boost to the dollar and investors turned their attention to a rally in the stock market.

Gold futures for December delivery GCZ5, -0.53%  lost $6.20, or 0.5%, to settle at $1,133.60 an ounce on Comex, following a gain of 0.6% a day earlier. December silver SIZ5, -1.24%  ended at $14.667 an ounce, up 4.7 cents, or 0.3%.

“We think too much is made of gold’s safe-haven status in the short run,” said Michael Armbruster, principal and co-founder of Altavest Worldwide Trading. When “investors need liquidity, they sell everything, including gold.”

“So, in the short run, gold is vulnerable to outside events,” but at the same time, “gold weakness based on outside markets can present a great buying opportunity,” he said.

Looking ahead, there may be more trouble on the horizon for equity markets, which could further pressure gold prices, said Armbruster. Gold bugs should “keep their powder dry and wait for even lower gold prices before going long.”

U.S. stocks on Wednesday rebounded after a two-day rout, while Chinese stocks stabilized.

The market has been looking to economic data for hints on the timing of the Federal Reserve’s next move on interest rates. On Wednesday, data on U.S. private-sector employment showed an increase of 190,000 jobs in August, with gains continuing at a slightly faster pace than a month earlier.

After gold prices settled Wednesday, the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book indicated growing wage pressure on the U.S. economy. Shortly after the release, gold prices edged a bit higher from their settlement price.

“It is of the utmost importance that the Fed does not wobble the cart of the stock market as we are heading into an U.S. election year,” said Yves Lamoureux, president of Lamoureux & Co., a market advisory firm based on behavioral economics.

Whatever comes out of the September central bank meeting will “lock the Fed out afterward of any subsequent interest rates move until 2017,” he said.

Lamoureux has said he sees a “seismic shift” and a “new and improved” fourth round of quantitative easing headed our way.

But he also said QE4 isn’t likely to help gold because he is bearish on bonds.

“Higher rates on bonds means higher real rates, and gold will not go up until this impact is priced in,” said Lamoureux.

So for now, he’s short on bonds, “at times” short on silver, and “neutral” on metals overall.

Other metals on Comex finished higher. December palladium PAZ5, -0.95%  added $4.15, or 0.7%, to $583.35 an ounce on the heels of a hefty 3.8% drop Tuesday. October platinum PLV5, -1.81%  added $5.20, or 0.5%, to $1,013.60 an ounce.

1655,"The Economist is totally misinformed about gold. If it truly would have analyzed the financial crisis, it would see that going off of the gold standard was one of the causes for the demise.

 Without tying printing of currency to something of precious value (land, drinking water, gold), the Fed had unlimited means to create a cancerous growth economy -- an economy that's growing for no other purpose than more growth. The Fed gave all this cheap money to banks, and the banks blew it all on bullshit purposes which has created a suburban nightmare of every American city.

 The issue of supply and demand is a moot point. Every leader has failed the planet by letting market forces control items that the market never created. The market nor individual effort and innovation created gold, oil, timber, and land. The market can't accurately assess the true value of these. (Oil, for example, is probably sold on the market for less than 1/20th of its actual value, based on the amount of watts of energy contained in just a cup of it).

 So there's no need to have yet another article lampooning the Middle East, when the West hasn't gotten it`s shit together whatsoever.

 (Editor: backtick in the last sentence is the possessive use of the quote.)"
1756,"Commodities have been in a bear market for the past seven years.  In the past several months, the downturn has accelerated significantly. This produces losers, but also winners, namely the developed world.

Three of the largest economic areas of the globe, Europe, Japan and the U.S., receive a net benefit from lower commodity prices.  Low oil and other raw materials prices, which affect consumers and manufacturers alike, are the equivalent of a massive tax reduction on consumers and corporations.

This holiday won't last forever, though: Low commodity prices will eventually curtail commodity supply and pricing will turn back up.  

 

 But in the meantime, for commodity producing countries, especially those with high debt levels, a vicious cycle is in play.  They have to produce even more supply at reduced prices to service their debt, fund government operations and protect market share.

Saudi Arabia is used to running government budget surpluses.  This year, the Saudi government has already burned through almost $62 billion of foreign currency reserves, and borrowed $4 billion from local banks in July - its first bond issue since 2007. The kingdom's budget deficit is expected to reach 20% of GDP in 2015.  Conditions are similar or worse in Russia, Canada, Australia, Venezuela, Brazil and many other commodity-centric countries.

Commodity prices and stocks (even before the selloff that started last month) are getting crushed.  The iShares S&P GSCI Commodity-Indexed Trust ( GSG ), an exchange-traded fund that tracks a Standard & Poor's commodity index , is down 14% year-to-date.  It is 24% below where it traded at the start of March 2009, the market's financial crisis low point.  The United States Oil ( USO ) ETF, which follows the petroleum industry, is almost 50% below its Great Recession low.  Steel, as measured by producer ArcelorMittal ( MT ) is down 80%.  Freeport-McMoran ( FCX ), a large copper and commodities company, is off by about half.

Over the past five-plus years since March 2009, the U.S. economy has expanded from a gross domestic product to $18.12 trillion as of the second quarter 2015 , from $14.09 trillion in 2009's second quarter .

A basic measure of economic activity is bulk transport.  Since March 2009, the iShares Transportation Average ETF ( IYT ) is up over 200%.  The CSX, Canadian National and Union Pacific railroad stocks have at least tripled during this time.  For comparison purposes, the Standard & Poor's 500 is up about 190%.

Normally, economic growth means rising demand and prices for commodities. But despite slow and steady growth, raw materials, including oil, agricultural chemicals, aluminum, copper and steel, are all down.

One explanation is the strength of the U.S. dollar.  Many commodities, like oil and gold, are priced in greenbacks.  Dollar strength means commodities are cheaper and vice versa. Because other nations' currencies are weaker, they can buy less oil, so demand for it flags, leading to falling prices.

The chart above shows that, although the dollar has appreciated since mid-2014, it has stabilized in the past several months.  Yet commodities have legged down sharply over the summer.  The most recent negative price action in commodities is likely tied to worries about economic growth rates in China .  In recent years, China's economy has been expanding at 7% plus.  In 2016, some economists are forecasting less than 4% growth. 

 

 Just recently, the People's Bank of China provided 110 billion yuan ($17.2 billion) to 14 financial institutions to help boost the economy, a day after injecting nearly $100 billion into two government policy banks.  China also began to devalue their currency in an effort to stimulate exports, because their goods become cheaper to foreign buyers.  Many investors view the interventions as desperate measures and an indication that China's economy and financial system is deteriorating rapidly.  The Chinese stock market continues to trade lower. 

 

 Slowing growth in China is a demand problem for commodities.  Possibly a bigger problem for commodities is oversupply.  During the past ten years, new commodity hedge funds, China and many emerging economies created steadily rising demand for commodities that stimulated a strong supply response.

Commodity companies were building new mines, processing centers, and other facilities to expand supply to meet demand.  At $100 per barrel, oil producers could not produce oil fast enough from new resources accessed by U.S. fracking technology.  This new supply has come on line and cannot be easily shut down in the short run.  U.S. oil production has been running near all-time highs even with oil ( West Texas Intermediate crude ) below $50 per barrel. Slowing that production is not easy, even with the  rig count  down by more than half over the past 12 months.  Although the price of oil popped up in recent days - briefly it was south of $40 - odds are that no big recovery is in the wings immediately. The same goes for so many other commodities.

218,"Officials say 20 people in southern Colorado were part of an illegal marijuana syndicate that harvested pot at eight properties — more than 1,000 plants — and shipped it to Florida via UPS.

Federal Drug Enforcement Administration agents and local police officers have confiscated 28 guns, more than $25,000 and 50 pounds of processed marijuana, according to court documents filed this week.

Search warrants were executed by DEA agents and local sheriff's offices in Custer and Freemont counties near the towns of Cotopaxi and Westcliffe.

Seventeen of the 20 people who have been charged are in custody, according to a news release from the District of Colorado's U.S. Attorney's Office.

All 20 defendants face a variety of drug trafficking charges, including conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute more than 1,000 plants of marijuana. They each face penalties of not less than 10 years, and up to life in federal prison.

Agents discovered four vacuum-sealed packages containing 1,249 grams of marijuana in one of the Westcliffe homes.

Agents observed suspects using United Parcel Service to ship four packages of marijuana to Florida.

Court documents say two Florida men, Griesys Leon and Rafael Hernandez, rented one of the eight homes where large-scale marijuana grows were in operation. The men raised suspicion by offering to pay more than the advertised rental rate.

Among those arrested was 51-year-old Jorge Rodriguez-Leiva, who had a Cuban passport."
621,"KANSAS CITY, Mo. – Miguel Cabrera was just trying to do his job.

Get a hit. Get on base. Get something – anything – going for a Detroit Tigers offense that had nothing going for it early Wednesday night against Royals right-hander Yordano Ventura.

""I tried to do my job,"" Cabrera said. ""I tried to do my work there. I tried to get on base. We've got a long inning.""

But after a full-count pitch from Ventura was called a strike by home plate umpire Quinn Wolcott to beginning the fourth inning of the Tigers' 12-1 loss, and after Cabrera exchanged words with him, the first baseman's night was cut short.

His body language after the borderline strike call said what he confirmed after the game: ""It was a bad call, man,"" Cabrera said.

And after the call, after manager Brad Ausmus and teammates J.D. Martinez and Victor Martinez whisked him towards the visitor's dugout, Cabrera was thrown out of the game by third base umpire Gary Cederstrom.

Why? ""You'd have to ask Gary that,"" Ausmus said. ""I'm not exactly sure why he was thrown out at that point because he was heading back to the dugout.""

And after the game, Cabrera was equally as unsure.

""If he tries to do his job and the umpire does what he wants to do, why do we play this game?"" Cabrera said. ""Why are we there if we try so hard for mistakes you don't do, like they throw you out because they want to throw you out? Because that's his fault. That's not my fault (like) I call pitches down, inside, up and in. That's not my fault. I try to do my job. That's it.""

The Tigers first baseman spoke subdued after the game, long since removed from the situation but frustrated nonetheless.

""He don't got nothing to do with that play,"" Cabrera said. ""Eventually they're gonna write something and Major League (Baseball) is gonna fine me, so I don't care. What am I gonna do? I didn't do anything.""

It wasn't the first time Cabrera was thrown out of the game by a third base umpire, he said, but it didn't make it any less surprising given the circumstances.

After a demonstrative disagreement with Wolcott, the Tigers appeared to tame Cabrera's disgust, which didn't register higher than a few words and a point at the plate or two. But as he walked towards the dugout, Cederstrom sent him packing.

It was the seventh career ejection for Cabrera and his first since May 21, 2014.

""I was walking to the dugout,"" Cabrera said. ""I was saying, 'You've got to tell him to do his job, don't tell me what to do.'""

2533,"NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amid ongoing challenges, financial metrics are still improving for U.S. state housing finance agencies (SHFAs), according to Fitch Ratings in a new report.

Throughout fiscal (FY) 2014, low conventional mortgage rates continued to suppress SHFAs' ability to originate new whole loan mortgages through SHFA-issued debt. FY 2014 results showed that aggregate assets fell by 4.5% and aggregate debt decreased by 6.9%. 'Declines in balance sheet numbers are expected to continue in the short term; however, some SHFAs are beginning a return to mortgage revenue bond issuance and this slow movement back may take time to appear on audited financial statement balance sheets,' said Senior Director Maura McGuigan.

FY 2014's results revealed that SHFAs remain financially sound. Fitch's report shows that equity continues to increase while leverage ratios are falling. In addition, net operating revenue for SHFAs rose for the fourth straight year. 'Rising net operating revenue for state housing finance agencies is likely attributed to rising profitability within housing bond programs and the up-front revenues generated from alternative financing methods in recent fiscal years,' said McGuigan.

Fitch also released its Fitch Analytical Comparative Tool (FACT) for the SHFA sector, featuring a broad overview of the industry, highlighting time-series trends across key profitability, capital-related, and financial metrics.

1622,"China's recent devaluation of the yuan surprised many market observers. The yuan, which is pegged to the dollar, had been rising in tandem with the U.S. currency -- in part because of expectations the Federal Reserve will increase interest rates soon. With China's economy slowing, currency markets were pressing for the yuan to depreciate, and the Chinese government, seeking to boost competitiveness in export markets, gave in to the pressure and moved the peg.

This isn't the first time the two countries' monetary policies have been closely intertwined. In the Great Depression, China found itself vulnerable to the price of silver, thanks to the misguided moves of U.S. policymakers.

The Great Depression was a global crisis -- almost. Every significant economy was devastated, with one notable exception: China. The reason was simple. In 1929, the U.S. and every other major nation pegged their currencies to gold. As the economic historian Barry Eichengreen has described, adherence to this standard punished countries by imposing ""golden fetters"" that led to crippling deflation. The fixed exchange rates of the gold standard helped transmit the monetary shocks around the world.

China, alone among the world's major economies, operated under a silver standard in which the currency was pegged to a specific weight of that metal. This had the effect of allowing its currency to depreciate, and largely shielded it from the worst effects of the Great Depression. The economic historian Ramon Myers concluded that ""China simply did not experience any national economic depression as the world depression deepened.""

As the Depression worsened in the early 1930s, the world's biggest economies came off the gold standard, allowing them to expand their money supplies and stimulate demand. As plenty of scholars have observed, countries that did so recovered more quickly. The United States took the plunge in 1933, during the first year of Franklin Roosevelt's presidency.

That was the first blow to the Chinese economy, ruining the competitive advantage it possessed when all other countries remained on the gold standard. As its currency began to appreciate, making its goods more expensive in world markets, its balance of payments turned negative, and imports exceeded exports. The worst was yet to come.

In the U.S., Sen. Key Pittman of Nevada was hatching a plan that would prove the undoing of China. Pittman, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, professed to be concerned that China was stuck with a silver currency that had limited purchasing power in global markets. If Pittman could drive up the price of silver, he proclaimed, China would see its purchasing power increase, enabling it to purchase more goods from the U.S.. Both countries would benefit.

It wasn't a coincidence that Nevada's economy was highly dependent on silver mining. Nor was the fact that Pittman had significant investments in the dormant mines around his state's famous Comstock Lode.

But however dubious Pittman's motives may have been, he possessed (forgive the expression) sterling political skills, and he soon marshaled these on behalf of his beloved silver interests, joining forces with legislators from other mining states to push through a comprehensive program to drive up the price of silver.

Pittman convinced Congress to pass a bill that obligated the Treasury Department to purchase domestic or foreign silver until the metal constituted a full quarter of the U.S. monetary supply or when the price hit $1.29. The Treasury Department raised legitimate concerns that the ""artificially swollen price"" of silver would drain the reserves of countries such as China. Pittman brushed these worries aside.

Once the law was enacted, Treasury began purchasing silver at the price of $1.29, netting silver producers a tidy 64.5 cents profit after mint charges. This amounted to a sizable subsidy to silver mining interests: The global price for silver was then a mere 35 cents an ounce.

The price soon rose, almost doubling within the year. The citizens of Nevada were pleased.

In China, however, the dramatic spike in silver prices turned the monetary system upside down. Although economists disagree about the magnitude of the blow to China, most subscribe to Milton Friedman's account, which shows that the economy effectively imploded in 1934. The spike in silver prices triggered major deflation. Exports plunged still further, and Arthur Young, who served as a financial adviser to China from 1927 to 1941, later noted that it passed from ""moderate prosperity to deep depression.""

Meanwhile, the Chinese government's efforts to stem the flow of silver overseas failed: In 1935, 173 million ounces left the country. In November of that year, the Chinese government threw in the towel, nationalized what silver was left, and put the country on a paper currency standard. Two years later, the Japanese invaded, forcing Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist government to undertake a huge armament campaign paid for with paper money. Without silver reserves, inflation soon spiraled out of control. Between 1937 and 1945, prices rose more than 150 percent a year.

This was a disaster for Chiang Kai-shek and a boon for Mao Tse-Tung's Communists. As the credibility of the Nationalist government collapsed along with its currency, Mao swept to power. This was definitely not the outcome that Senator Pittman imagined when he first proposed to pump up the price of silver.

So a word of caution to today's monetary policymakers: even seemingly modest modifications can have profound, unforeseen consequences.

567,"Macau's 2Q GDP quarter-on-quarter decline of 6.4%, following a 12.4% fall in 1Q, is a larger move than that factored into Fitch Ratings' forecast.

Fitch expects Macau's economy to shrink by 16% year-on-year in real terms in 2015. The contraction underscores the risks to Macau's economy from its heavy reliance on gaming revenues from Chinese visitors, and its vulnerability to shifts in mainland government policy.

""Gaming revenues have begun to stabilize in recent months, but the potential remains for substantial shifts to our forecasts - both on the upside and downside - with the evolving economic and policy conditions in China,"" says Fitch.

Fitch expects Macau's gaming revenues to drop by about 30% in 2015, and the rapid pace of economic contraction thus far has been linked directly to the falling top line at casinos. The feedthrough to the broader domestic economy has been limited, though, as the impact has mostly been absorbed by casino operators through narrowing margins.

All major casinos have nevertheless remained profitable, and unemployment has stayed low as hotels have sought to retain staff in advance of new casino resort openings in 2016-2017.

""There have been some signs that the domestic economy is beginning to slow,"" says Fitch. ""Household consumption and capital investment growth have fallen, albeit from a high base.""

Fitch adds that government has also announced measures to tighten spending, which will help to mitigate the impact on the fiscal account but may squeeze domestic demand.

Risks are also growing to income growth and to Macau banks' loan growth, which could feed through to a further slowdown in the domestic property market.

Yet Fitch maintains a Stable Outlook on Macau's AA- rating, reflecting the territory's exceptionally strong sovereign balance sheet and external position. It has no debt liabilities, and retains fiscal reserves and accumulated surpluses in excess of 100% of GDP - enough to almost cover six years of expenditures at the 2015 level projected by government.

Furthermore, Macau's banking sector benefits from conservative underwriting standards, which supports asset quality and relatively healthy capitalization. Institutional support from mainland Chinese parents in terms of capital, funding, and operations also provides a buffer to mitigate unexpected shocks.

Fitch expects gaming revenues to continue to stabilize in 2H15, but recovery could be slowed by a number of policy measures. These include a full smoking ban at casinos, restrictions on mainland visitor arrivals, and a continued slowdown in the Chinese economy.

""As such, there remains the potential for the outlook on Macau to change rapidly and significantly. An economic/policy scenario which could reduce Macau's vast fiscal reserves and weaken its balance-sheet buffer remains a tail risk,"" says the ratings agency."
2225,"Former USC linebacker Morgan Breslin is suing his alma mater for breach of contract, negligence and fraud by intentional misrepresentation, alleging that school representatives misguided him into purchasing a disability insurance policy that he was later unable to claim following an injury that would eventually end his career.

Breslin, who played for the Trojans in 2012 and 2013, filed the lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court on Aug. 28. He is seeking unspecified damages.

The suit claims that Breslin, 24, purchased “a total and permanent disability insurance policy that, in theory, protected him in the event he was unable to play in the NFL due to an injury sustained while playing for USC.” Breslin ultimately purchased the policy from Amtrust at Lloyd’s, part of Amtrust, a multinational property and casualty insurance company, “based upon the advice and representations of USC.”

The claim states that “USC directed Breslin in every step related to the policy” and purportedly breached its contract with Breslin by “failing to manage plaintiff Breslin’s relationship with Amtrust on Breslin’s behalf.”

After “Breslin was unable to play football and was rendered totally and permanently disabled as defined by the policy,” he made a claim under the policy in May of 2014 that was denied in December of the same year, according to the suit.

Following the denial, Amtrust filed a separate lawsuit in the state of New Jersey seeking to have Breslin’s policy “declared void,” citing “that the application, which Breslin completed with USC’s assistance, and the medical information that USC provided directly to the underwriter, contained material omission and misstatements.”

Prior to the 2013-2014 season, Breslin was designated as an Exceptional Student-Athlete by the NCAA, a program that offers incentives to student-athletes to stay in school, complete their degrees and play another year by giving student-athletes the opportunity to purchase disability insurance.

The suit reads that Breslin and USC had reached a contractual agreement wherein USC promised to “manage Plaintiff Breslin’s relationship with Amtrust on Breslin’s behalf” in return for Breslin’s promise to “forgo the NFL draft and remain at USC and play football.”

Under this same contract, USC purportedly agreed to “pay for all medical costs incurred by Breslin” while at USC. According to the lawsuit, USC’s breach of this aforementioned contract is the primary reason for Breslin’s decision to seek unspecified damages.

The suit also alleges that USC interfered with Breslin’s right to receive benefits from the insurance by controlling the flow of information between him and Amtrust.

Breslin, who recorded 13 sacks and 19.5 tackles for loss in 2012, sustained a hip injury that took place in a 62-41 loss to Arizona State in September 2013 — the same game that ended up resulting in the dismissal of head coach Lane Kiffin on the tarmac of Los Angeles International Airport.

A couple weeks after his injury, Ed Orgeron, who was the interim head coach at the time, went on to say that Breslin was one of his favorite players to coach during the course his career.

After Breslin went undrafted in the 2014 NFL draft, he had a brief stint with the San Francisco 49ers as a free agent, but did not make the team’s roster.

Breslin and attorneys were unavailable for comment regarding the suit. The University said it does not comment on pending litigation."

2044,"A businessman who swindled Barclays out of millions by flirting with his female bank manager was jailed for more than three years today.

Nicholas Marcou, 49, who supplied major supermarkets including Sainsburys, Asda, Aldi and Lidl with fruit and nuts, persuaded the bank to raise his credit limit by charming his 'relationship' manager, Joanne Haslegrave.

He was even invited on hospitality days by the bank's CEO.

Marcou, the managing director of Abacus, was today jailed for three and a half years for inventing invoices totalling just over £38 million to extract cash from the bank for his ailing business.

He began the swindle when his company got into financial difficulties and by the time Barclays forced it into administration the bank had lost £8.6 million.

Sentencing him at Southwark Crown Court today Judge Michael Grieve said: ""When your company got into financial difficulties you and your father between you embarked on a system of false invoicing, so that Barclays paid 85% in advance of wholly fictional invoices.

""That amounted to a total of £38 million being paid out by Barclays which resulted in an irretrievable loss of £8.6 million.

""You kept this fraud going for a considerable period of time through your charm, in particular with your relationship manager.

""Such was the good impression that you made at Barclays that for a while you were a guest of the CEO at the time.

""You were clearly very charismatic but you were also very dishonest.""

Barclays Asset and Sales Finance supplied Abacus with advances on invoices that it had issued while it was waiting for customers, including Sainsburys, Asda, Aldi, Lidl, to pay.

The bank paid Marcou's company 85% of the value of the invoice, and then the remaining 15% when the customer paid the balance, less a service charge.

Initially there was a cap of £5 million on the total that Abacus could obtain from Barclays for unpaid invoices.

But in his role as 'front of house', Marcou flirted his way into convincing his Barclays relationship manager Ms Haslegrave to up the cap, and it was eventually raised four times to a final 'ceiling' of £9 million in May 2009.

Prosecuting, Ben Douglas-Jones said: ""There were days at the races, corporate hospitality and a slightly flirtatious context which meant he was able to ask for more than he would otherwise have been able to.""

Marcou was behind 12,000 invoices to the value of £88 million that were uploaded to the Barclays system between 2007 and 2009.

What Barclays didn't know was that £38 million worth of the invoices had been completely invented - making this an example of 'fresh-air' invoicing fraud.

When problems with the Abacus account became apparent because their invoices were taking longer and longer to be paid, an audit was carried out and Barclays put the company into administration.

The payment account balance stood at £8.7million and Barclays could only recover £145,000 leaving them with a loss of £8.6million.

Mr Douglas-Jones said: ""Nicholas Marcous perpetuated this fraud in large part by engaging in continued deception in his dealings with Joanne Haslegrave.

""She was a relationship director for larger businesses employed by Barclays Corporate Sales Finance.

""She became Abacus' relationship manager from 20th Feb 2008. On that date she took over the responsibility for Abacus from a colleague. She remained Abacus' relationship manager until it entered administration in December 2009.""

He said: ""The fraud worked by providing false details of a large number of invoices.

""Abacus was a company of some standing and supplied Sainsburys, Asda and Lidl and the like. It was supplying some of the largest supermarkets.

""Barclays would pay out 85% of the invoice amount.

""When the customer paid out, Barclays would pay Abacus the rest, 15%, less any charges.

""The total payment was limited to a cap, initially £5 million and that was raised.

""He was able to use clearly considerable charisma and charm to convince Barclays to increase the limit to very significant levels.""

During the trial Mr Douglas Jones told the jury: ""It was Nicholas Marcou who was principally responsible for dealing with Barclays throughout and that this fraud went undetected for such a sustained period of time must have been down, at least in part, to Nicholas Marcou's charisma, charm and his powers of dissimulation and deception.""

Marcou, who appeared in court in a double-breasted navy blazer with slicked back hair, was said to be previously a man of good character who suffered from claustrophobia who 'has lost everything'.

He received a discount of 40% discount on his sentence in recognition of his guilty plea and his help with the prosecution and was given sentences of three and a half years for each fraud and fraudulent trading count, and three years for the count of acquiring criminal property, all to run concurrently.

Marcou, of Barnet, whose wife and three children aged 17, 16, and 9 are standing by him, pleaded guilty on 12 May to fraud, fraudulent trading and the acquisition of criminal property between 30 September 2007 and 19 July 2009.

The jury failed to reach a verdict on the company's accountant Rajesh Devani who had also been charged with fraud and fraudulent trading."

1083,"Artist rendering of the new electrified Caltrain. Caltrain officials are inching closer toward a more than $1.5 billion electrification project by considering several steps to secure funding and partnering with other agencies to consider using eminent domain in worst-case scenarios. The Peninsula Corridor Joint Powers Board is set to meet Thursday, Sept. 3, and will discuss a handful of items related to the Caltrain Modernization Program — a system overhaul that involves purchasing new trains, a high-tech control system and electrifying 51 miles of track between San Jose and San Francisco. Officials hope the project aimed at increasing capacity to account for an astronomical growth in ridership while greatly reducing carbon emissions, will be 75 percent complete by 2020 and fully implemented by 2040. “All of these actions that the board is taking are critical to meeting the milestones for Caltrain electrification. We need to continue to pursue an aggressive timeline to meet the 2020 electrification deadline because we are already experiencing a capacity crunch that is only going to continue to get worse,” said Caltrain spokeswoman Jayme Ackemann. A notable achievement includes officials having identified other sources for its previously estimated nearly $450 million gap in funding — an item that will eventually be addressed through a supplemental agreement between Caltrain and six other transportation authorities that oversee the 51 miles of track as well as the city and county of San Francisco and the Metropolitan Transportation Commission. The six parties may commit an additional $98 million, an agreement Caltrain will likely consider in October. The remaining gap is expected to be closed by a Federal Transit Administration Core Capacity Grant for $220 million and the California High-Speed Rail Authority — which already committed nearly $750 million — to contribute an additional $113 million, according to a staff report. The exact details of the agreement are being finalized and each entity’s regulatory body will have to approve their own agreement. Having identified enough to fund the project through 2020 will allow the JPB to proceed with hiring a consultant early next year. That will be a significant contract as the chosen firm will finalize the design and carry the project to construction, Ackemann said. “This was a critical next step because we cannot award the electrification [request for proposals] at the end of the year as we are scheduled to do, without having a full funding plan in place. So we’re very pleased,” Ackemann said. On Thursday, the board is considering a partnership with the San Mateo County Transit District and the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority for assistance if eminent domain becomes necessary along the electrified corridor. In the worst-case scenarios identified in the environmental impact report for the project, Caltrain may need to purchase or arrange 1.5 acres of easements for substations in South San Francisco and San Jose, as well as strips of land that make up to 18 acres throughout constrained areas along the 51 miles of track. Up to 102 parcels in San Mateo County and another 56 in Santa Clara County could be affected, according to a staff report. Ackemann said Caltrain has been in communication with all of the affected property owners and eminent domain would be a last resort. “I want to emphasize there are no full properties that are being proposed [for taking], it’s slivers [of land],” Ackemann said. “But until we have this board action we don’t have the authority to really engage in direct negotiations with any property owners. And of course, it’s our hope that we don’t ever have to use the eminent domain authority; our goal would be to reach successful negotiations with each homeowner along the corridor.” But Caltrain’s modernization project has had its share of controversy. Atherton, the Transportation Solutions Defense and Education Fund along with the Community Coalition on High-Speed Rail filed a lawsuit against Caltrain in February. The suit alleges Caltrain’s environmental review of the project was inadequate because it doesn’t consider the impacts to traffic, tree removal, station configurations and electricity demands. It also claims Caltrain should have considered the potential impacts of bringing high-speed rail to the Peninsula. The local transit agency became intertwined with the state’s proposed bullet train from Los Angeles to San Francisco when the two opted for a blended system in which Caltrain and high-speed rail could share the electrified tracks between San Jose and San Francisco — an improvement from the initial proposal to create separate tracks that could have resulted in many properties being taken through eminent domain. Caltrain has maintained its modernization project does not clear the way for high-speed rail as the high-speed rail proposal would need to undergo its own, separate environmental review. The lawsuit was recently transferred to Contra Costa County Superior Court and Ackemann said Caltrain is confident it will be able to successfully litigate the case. Other items being addressed Thursday include an update and revised funding for a new high-tech safety control system. The modernization program includes Communications Based Overlay Signal System and Positive Train Control, a federally required GPS-based technology capable of preventing train-to-train collisions. The board will hear an update on the status the system currently being installed and consider approving an additional $10 million toward the nearly $160 million control system project that Congress ordered railroads complete by the end of this year. Another technical agenda item includes soliciting a revolving line of credit for up to $125 million. Ackemann said this financing mechanism will help Caltrain progress with the project while support trickles in from a variety of sources. “It’s pretty standard for a large-scale project like this. Basically it allows us to continue to move forward with work and pay contractors without any delay as we receive funding,” Ackemann said. “We’re getting funding from high-speed rail, from our partner agencies and through various other funding programs like the cap-and-trade program. … But all of those funding streams don’t come in at once. So that revolving loan allows us to continue work as we identify funding when it becomes available.” Visit caltrain.com/projectsplans/CaltrainModernization.html for more information about the Caltrain Modernization Program."
1165,"Mobile app marketing is ultra-competitive right now, as teams are tasked with intense goals like “generate 1 million users ASAP!”

With that sense of urgency, growth, and popularity in the space, an influx of “marketing help” for mobile app marketers has emerged. That help comes in the form of paid software vendors and analytics solutions, marketing agencies, conferences, case studies, content, blogs, etc.

But what’s really working? Furthermore, how do we separate hype from truth?

In a recent Mobile User Acquisition report compiled by VB’s John Koetsier, marketers listed their 16 top user acquisition tactics, shown below:

What sticks out here? Three things should stand out when looking at this chart.

1. It takes more than just social

Data: Social media is the most effective ad channel for only 14.8 percent of marketers.

Meaning: There’s no question that paid social is a crucial part of mobile app marketing (and according to Koetsier’s report, it is the leader), but it’s important to remember it’s not the only part of your marketing strategy. And 85.2 percent of the time, it’s not the most effective channel.

2. The focus on digital ad spend is still forming

Data: Of the 16 user acquisition channels listed in Koetsier’s chart above, 8 of the tactics (7 if you discount “other”) can be executed without paid ads (Incentivized installs, ASO, Email, PR, In-app viral tactics, Web organic search, Offer walls, Other). Another way to consider the data here is to note that 50.8 percent of marketers agree that a non-paid marketing tactic is their most effective user acquisition strategy.

Meaning: Numerous reports would have marketers believing that the answer to mobile app success is paid spend. While “paid” certainly helps fuel growth and should be a core focus, it’s not the only way, and it is one component of an overall marketing mix. For instance, look at the first two leading acquisition strategies in Koetsier’s chart. According to the data, 26.8 percent of marketers say that paid on either social or video is their most effective channel. But the next four tactics (incentivized, ASO, email, PR) represent 33.6 percent of marketers and are all non-paid ad tactics.

*Three things to highlight about this section: First, remember that this chart is representative of digital only, and thus tactics such as TV are not included. Second, this chart asked marketers what their most effective tactic was; hence, there are other marketing tactics not listed here. Third, just because a tactic doesn’t require paid ad budget in no way means it’s free — it often needs budget, employee/agency salaries, or both.

Data: Marketers are investing in paid and organic, as represented in Koetsier’s report.

Meaning: We’re in the age of mobile, and things are only getting more competitive, especially with mobile ad spending heading north of $100 billion next year.

As more focus is shifting to mobile, three types of marketing teams are emerging, or re-emerging.

First, there are the teams that solely believe in organic, similar to the Inbound/Content Marketing movement that rose a few years ago. Second, there are the teams that spend the majority of their time focused on paid ads (especially if they’re a recently funded startup or an innovative brand with budget). The third type of team, which is the leader, is the one to invest in a balanced strategy of paid and organic. Does this strive for balance sound familiar? It should, because it’s quite similar to the way we saw digital marketing emerge, grow, and ultimately manifest itself from past to present.

The best marketing teams in the world today aren’t the ones that focus on organic OR paid acquisition tactics, but rather the ones that have a balanced combination of paid AND organic down to a science. It will be these teams that we’ll look back on in a few short years (when we’ve all moved on to wearables marketing) and say, “They were the winners of the mobile era.”

111,"The Czech central bank may need to stick to loose monetary policy beyond next year as price growth remains below target and global economic trends pose downside risks to the inflation outlook, Vice Governor Vladimir Tomsik said.

While Czech output is “relatively robust,” it’s partly driven by one-time factors, and the economy will be “far from overheating” next year, Tomsik said in a blog on the central bank’s website on Wednesday. He reiterated the bank will keep the current limit on koruna gains, set at around 27 against the euro, at least until the middle of 2016.

Despite economic growth accelerating to 4.4 percent from a year earlier in the second quarter -- a seven-year high -- the slowing expansion in China and other emerging markets, combined with declining commodity prices, may create disinflationary risks for the Czech Republic, Tomsik said.

“That means that the need to maintain loose monetary policy may last for longer than currently suggested by the forecast,” he said.

His comments echo the minutes from the bank’s Aug. 6 rate-setting meeting, at which policy makers repeatedly said monetary conditions not fully passing through to inflation and the prospect of low wage growth “could be an argument for a later exit from the use of the exchange rate as a monetary-policy instrument.”

The monetary authority in Prague currently sees inflation staying below its 2 percent target until early 2017. The bank’s forecast envisages using weak-koruna policy until the end of next year.

The koruna traded little changed at 27.022 per euro as of 10:44 a.m., remaining near the cap level after gaining 2.4 percent against the euro this year."

1271,"A new report says auto supplier mergers will hit an all-time high this year, surpassing the previous high set in 2007.

Auto suppliers face rising development costs and cost pressure from automakers, which places more pressure on them to consolidate. Rising auto sales also have given some auto suppliers enough cash to make big deals.

PwC says in a new study released Monday that supplier mergers and acquisitions will likely top $48 billion in 2015, easily overtaking the previous high in 2007 of $35 billion (measured in transactions closed within the calendar year). Excluding the major deals — above $500 million — the number of deals will remain approximately the same at 200 and with about $100 million in transaction value.

“Auto supplier consolidation is fueled by a number of factors, including the long-term growth in global vehicle production, five years of double-digit growth for many global suppliers, technological developments related to light weighting, powertrain enhancements, ‘connected car’ and autonomous driving, as well as a strong uptick in private equity activity,” said Dietmar Ostermann, PwC Strategy&’s Global Automotive Advisory Leader and one of the authors of the study.

The study reveals that for the fifth consecutive year, North American suppliers are the strongest consolidators in 2015. Nine out of the top ten consolidators are North American suppliers.

The study says in the last 12 months, 42 percent of all deals were in powertrain and chassis systems.

In May, German auto supplier ZF Friedrichshafen completed its acquisition of one of the largest U.S. auto suppliers, Livonia-based TRW Automotive Holdings Corp., in a $12.4 billion deal. Last month two big automotive suppliers — Arkansas-based Pace Industries and Muskegon-based Port City Group — said they would merge and operate under the Pace Industries name.

Michigan has more auto supplier-related jobs than any state in the U.S., but it suffered brutal losses in the last decade, as hundreds of factories closed and much of the work was shipped to Mexico, China or other low-wage countries.

In 2000, Michigan had 230,000 people working in the auto parts sector — a figure that fell as low as 73,000 in 2009. The sector currently employs 120,400 people in Michigan, up 5,500 jobs over the previous year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

But despite consolidation, 61 of the top 100 automotive suppliers to the world are headquartered in Michigan, the Detroit Regional Chamber of Commerce says.

The United States has 564,000 working in the auto parts manufacturing sector — up nearly 180,000 since the recent low of 386,000 in 2009 — but still significantly below the 850,000 people employed in 2002.

Johnson Controls Inc., one of the nation’s largest auto suppliers and a major force in Michigan, said in July it will spin off its auto business.

Milwaukee-based Johnson Controls remains a major parts source to Detroit’s Big Three and has a big presence in the state. The company’s automotive division is a big employer in Michigan. It has facilities in Detroit, Lansing, Monroe, Battle Creek, Port Huron, Warren, Holland and Highland Park, and a tech center in Plymouth.

“I’d love to stay in the automotive business,” Alex Molinaroli, chairman and CEO of Johnson Controls, told CNBC. But he said the company will focus on its other businesses, including energy storage and building trades that he thinks are undervalued. Johnson Controls also makes York air conditioners.

Molinaroli said that by selling the auto business, it will be able to get enough investment to thrive. He thinks it will also allow for a higher valuation for its business, especially its battery business. Another issue is the auto business is cyclical, even though auto sales have risen for six consecutive years.

The company’s auto business represents just over half of its revenue.

Over the years, it has acquired Michigan suppliers or plants. In 1996, it bought Holland’s Prince Automotive in a $1.35 billion cash deal, making it the world’s largest automotive interior parts supplier. It also bought Visteon’s Highland Park plant.

Johnson Controls’ auto facilities in Michigan include a 750,000-square-foot campus in Holland with more than 1,000 employees; its Plymouth Technical campus is headquarters of its North American auto business. The campus has over 500,000 square feet of office space and more than 1,000 employees within three buildings.

Citi analyst Itay Michaeli said a spinoff or sale could prompt more consolidation in the seating business — and could be positive for competitors Lear, which is based in Southfield, and Ontario-based Magna."

478,"The big question is: ‘Why is this happening?‘ There are three major theories. The first is that China is responding to an economic slowdown by depreciating its currency in order to stimulate exports. The second is that China is responding to market pressures, which are pushing the yuan lower due to the aforementioned downturn. The third is that China’s government is simply preparing the country’s currency for internationalization, in accordance with the recommendations of the International Monetary Fund.

Let’s start with the third theory, which — I’m sorry to say — makes no sense at all. Nicholas Lardy of the Peterson Institute for International Economics makes the IMF argument in a recent blog post:

‘(China’s) motivation for this move is almost certainly tied to another objective: China’s aspiration to have the RMB join the four other major international currencies (the dollar, the euro, the pound sterling, and the yen) that comprise the so- called special drawing rights (SDR) basket of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The IMF executive board will decide in November whether to include the RMB in that basket...

‘The action taken by China, far from being a step to manipulate its currency, is actually an effort to let the RMB fluctuate according to the dynamics of the exchange markets...China’s move is consistent with long-standing advice from the IMF and from the US Treasury, both of which have repeatedly called for China to adopt a more market-determined exchange rate policy.‘

This is surely isn’t the main reason behind China’s move. First of all, the timing is suspect. China is undergoing what seems to be a sharp economic slowdown. It recently suffered a collapse in stock prices, which is often (though not always) a harbinger of recession. That stock market crash came on the heels of a fall in the far more important real estate market. All in all, China looks like it is going through exactly the same bubble-and-bust dynamic that is all too familiar to advanced economies.

That the Chinese government would choose exactly this moment to liberalize its currency is just too conincidental to be believed. There are other reasons to doubt the internationalization story. For one thing, the move sparked upheaval in financial markets around the world. If everyone had known that China was going to do something like this in preparation for the IMF’s November decision, those markets probably would have priced in the devaluation ahead of time. Also, the government’s action isn’t really consistent with a permanent market-oriented currency liberalization -- if it were really preparing to float the yuan, it seems like it would have dramatically widened the band in which the currency is allowed to trade, rather than simply resetting the target value by fiat.

To me, the ‘internationalization‘ explanation seems to fit with a general tendency of commentators -- both Western and Chinese -- to portray the Chinese government as all-knowing, wise and in firm control of the economy. As my Bloomberg View colleague Justin Fox recently wrote, this probably isn’t the case.

Instead, we should think of China’s devaluation as a response to its deteriorating economic situation. That still leaves the question of whether the response is an accession to market pressures, or just an attempt to stimulate exports. The real question is whether the yuan is overvalued or undervalued.

If the yuan is overvalued, then markets want to sell it, and the government is merely giving them the opportunity to do so, in order to avoid a more dramatic downward revaluation later on. That would seem to fit with stories of increased capital flight from China. If people really do think the yuan is overvalued and the economy is about to slow dramatically, it would be a reason to pull money out of the country (though doing so is difficult because of capital controls).

But few are willing to claim that the yuan is overvalued. For more than a decade, the conventional wisdom has been that China keeps its currency pegged artificially low in order to stimulate exports -- a policy generally known as mercantilism. If that is the case, then China’s devaluation is simply more of the same -- an attempt to ward off recession by making the currency even more undervalued.

Either way, the devaluation isn’t a good sign for the Chinese economy. Peking University professor Christopher Balding explains why in a recent blog post. He argues that the devaluation will probably make markets expect further devaluation, which will tend to accelerate capital flight, especially if the U.S. Federal Reserve hikes interest rates, as it is expected to do. Devaluation will also hurt Chinese companies that have borrowed money in dollars, since it will now be harder for those companies to pay back their loans.

So whatever the real reason for China’s devaluation, it’s bad news and a bad signal for the Chinese economy.

617,"Executives have a choice in how they run their operations. They can run them in a way that uses people as interchangeable parts. Or they can run them in a way that leverages a skilled, capable, motivated workforce. Both ways can be profitable. But the employee-centered way is a better way — even in low-cost retail.

In my research, I’ve found that retailers using an employee-centered operations strategy, which I call the good jobs strategy, have two strategic advantages. First, they differentiate themselves by offering low prices and good service at the same time. Second, they are better at adapting to changes in customer demand, technology, and regulation. The good jobs strategy is a strategy in which everyone — customers, employees, and investors — wins.

Since my book on this topic came out in 2014, one of the questions I’ve been asked the most is: “How can investors or customers identify which companies in a particular industry are following a good jobs strategy?” To answer this question, my MIT students and I set out to create a good jobs score. We started with food retail and plan to expand it to other settings once we get feedback on our methodology. (So please tell us what you think!) Focusing on the 14 U.S. food retailers that publicly file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), we scored them in a range of 1 to 10.

Costco had the top score of 9.2, followed by Whole Foods and Publix, at 7.5 and 6.9, respectively. All the other food retailers we scored came in under 6, so there is a lot of room for improvement.

The score is a combination of three components: customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction, and productivity. Companies that follow a good jobs strategy design and manage their operations in a way that allows them to achieve high employee satisfaction, high customer satisfaction, and high productivity simultaneously. A company that does not follow a good jobs strategy will often sacrifice employee satisfaction or customer satisfaction for lower costs, which is commonly thought to be the only way to keep the “low” in low-cost retail. For this reason, we calculate the score as the geometric mean of these components rather than the arithmetic mean, so that a low score on any one of the components brings down the overall score more. In effect, we penalize the sort of trade-offs that the good jobs strategy renders obsolete.

For the good jobs score, we decided to focus on these three outcomes, as opposed to the particular operational practices that drive them. The reason: Collecting data on operational practices such as staffing, level of standardization and empowerment, and extent of cross-training was not feasible without having access to a large number of companies. In our early conversations with some companies, we found that they would not provide such data if we used those data to rank them publicly.

Even collecting data on employee satisfaction, customer satisfaction, and productivity was challenging. Although employee satisfaction and customer satisfaction are both important drivers of success, most companies do not disclose such data to their investors. We therefore had to rely on secondary data sources, which are not standardized and may have biases.

To create a customer-satisfaction score, we collected data from the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI), Consumer Reports, and Yelp. Although each of these sources takes a different approach to measuring satisfaction, the results were pretty consistent. For the 14 companies we scored, the correlation between Yelp and Consumer Reports is 0.79, between Yelp and ACSI is 0.93, and between Consumer Reports and ACSI is 0.76. (As a reminder, a perfect correlation would be 1.0.)

To create an employee-satisfaction score, we collected data from Glassdoor.com and Indeed.com. Neither site can affirm that the people who provide data about companies actually work there. In addition, respondents to both sites are self-selecting; thus the data cannot be considered to have been gathered from a random sample of employees. But again, we found that these data sources were pretty consistent. For the 14 companies we scored, the correlation between Glassdoor and Indeed is 0.96.

To create a productivity score, we collected data from 10-K filings with the SEC. We looked at three measures of productivity: sales per square foot, sales per employee, and inventory turnover. Even those data are imperfect at best. Let me give you an example. Inventory turnover is calculated as cost of goods sold (COGS) divided by average inventory level. But even within the same SIC code, there is inconsistency in how companies report COGS. Some include depreciation of inventory; some don’t. Some include promotional expenses; some don’t. Some include compensation and benefits for some of their employees; some don’t. There are also differences in the merchandise mix of different companies. Of course, all the food retailers sell food, but some, like Walmart and Costco, also sell products such as electronics and furniture that are expected to have lower turnover than grocery items.

Clearly, investors concerned with how a company earns its profits — and whether it’s doing the best it could do for customers, employees, and the investors themselves — need better data to assess how well a company manages its operations. I hope that the good jobs score will encourage more companies to report these data.

On goodjobscore.com, we report a lot of other information about each of the 14 companies. Please take a look and let me know how we can improve the score and the website."
239,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Puerto Rico is getting attention from 2016 presidential hopefuls, who are making early stops in the U.S. territory, likely in part due to the rapidly growing number of Puerto Ricans living in the key battleground state of Florida.

Contenders for the White House, such as Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Marco Rubio, are scheduled on Friday to visit the island, which is trying to dig itself out of a wrenching fiscal crisis.

While Puerto Rico's residents will not be eligible to cast presidential votes in November 2016, they have a voice in the primaries and, as the island's economy has suffered, an increasing number have moved to U.S. states, where they can vote - particularly Florida.

""The Puerto Rico vote in Florida, a swing state, is substantial,"" said U.S. Senator Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat. ""The larger you have a Puerto Rican community in Florida ... the more you have what has generally been a Democratic vote.""

The state's Puerto Rican population has doubled in little more than a decade, according to U.S. Census data. In Ohio, another swing state, the population of Puerto Ricans also increased from 2000 to 2013.

Clinton, the leading Democratic candidate and Rubio, a Florida senator, follow former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, a Republican, and former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley, a Democrat contender, who have both visited.

Clinton, Bush and O'Malley have addressed the Puerto Rico issue of bankruptcy access, voicing support for a push to enable the territory's public agencies to take advantage of U.S. bankruptcy laws - bills which are yet to receive the necessary Republican support in Congress.

Clinton, who won the most Democratic delegates in Puerto Rico during her failed 2008 presidential bid, will discuss the “unequal treatment” of the territory by U.S. healthcare policies, according to her campaign. Rubio will be visiting with supporters at a restaurant, his campaign said.

A spokeswoman for Bush's campaign said their engagement with different demographics within the Hispanic community was a ""core part of our campaign"" and that it was important to engage with each and every demographic within the Hispanic community.

An O'Malley campaign spokeswoman said he has led on Puerto Rico issues, adding ""these are our fellow citizens and they deserve equal treatment."" She said there was ""no question that the Puerto Rican vote is critical in many areas.""

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo is also scheduled to visit next week. New York has the largest population of Puerto Ricans in the 50 U.S. states.

For presidential candidates, the visits could boost their images beyond the island.

""(They) will be covered by Puerto Rican media outlets that in turn are read, watched and listened to by Puerto Rican populations (in the states),"" said Alex Patton, a Republican political consultant in Gainesville, Florida.

The number of Puerto Ricans in U.S. states significantly outnumbers those on the island itself, according to Census data. Florida is home to the second largest population of Puerto Ricans among the states and the community there has added almost as many Puerto Ricans as the Cuban population in recent years.

""As the population has matured, has grown over the last particularly 10 years, you've really seen that Puerto Rican vote become a fairly solid bloc for Democrats,"" said Tallahassee-based Democratic strategist Steven Schale. ""For the Democratic nominee, maintaining, growing the margins that we've got among Puerto Ricans in the last few cycles is critical to winning the state.""

Schale said Puerto Ricans typically sympathize with Democratic positions on issues such as healthcare.

However, Patton said Puerto Ricans' voting pattern was not so predictable because their vote in many cases is new - as thousands have recently arrived - and they have not formed as deep an attachment to one party.

Orlando is a popular destination for Puerto Ricans. Strategists say the key area to track is the Interstate 4 corridor, named for the highway which cuts across central Florida, passing through Orlando as well as Tampa.

""The Puerto Rican community ... is playing a pivotal role in the central-Florida political landscape,"" said Miami-based Democratic strategist Christian Ulvert. ""If you're losing the Puerto Rican community in central Florida, you have to make that up somewhere.""

Florida is a critical swing state because its sizeable population gives it an outsized influence in selecting a president and it is up for grabs.

""Without Florida, any Republican has almost a zero chance of capturing the White House,"" said Patton."
507,"Good morning! Here's what you need to know.

It's jobs day in America. At 8:30 a.m. ET, we learned that US companies added 173,000 nonfarm payrolls in August. While that was lighter than the 217,000 expected by economists, the prior two months' numbers were revised up by 44,000. Notably, the unemployment rate fell to 5.1% from 5.3% in August. This is the lowest level since April 2008.

Why this jobs day matters. This was the last jobs report before the September 16-17 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, which is when many economists believe the Fed could hike interest rates for the first time since June 2006. The consensus has been that as long as the report isn't a disaster, the Fed will begin to tighten monetary policy with a rate hike in September.

Markets are tumbling. It's risk off in global markets. US futures are in the red, with Dow futures down 152 points and S&P futures down 16 points. Europe is plunging, with Britain's FTSE 100 down 1.6%, Germany's DAX down 1.7%, France's CAC 40 down 1.7%, and Spain's IBEX down 1.5%. Asia closed lower, with Japan's Nikkei down 2.1%, Korea's Kospi down 1.5%, and Australia's ASX 200 down 0.2%. Chinese markets were closed for a holiday.

A crack in the German economy. Factory orders in Germany tumbled 1.4% in July, which was much worse than the 0.6% decline expected by economist. ""The main hit came from export orders, which fell 5.2% month-to-month, driven by a 9.5% plunge in non-eurozone orders following a 6.1% increase in June,"" Pantheon Macroeconomics' Claus Vistesen said. ""The fall in export orders to non-eurozone economies was chiefly driven by a 13.0% fall in the volatile capital-goods sector, and we expect mean-reversion next month. We also expect mean-reversion in consumer goods orders, which fell 6.3%, pulled down by a 19.5% month-to-month collapse in export orders to other eurozone economies. Overall, this report confirms that the underlying trend is not as strong as implied by the surge in June.""

G-20 finance ministers meet. Finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of 20 nations meet in Turkey to discuss the state of the world economy. Among expected talking points are the Federal Reserve and the prospect for tighter monetary policy via higher interest rates. ""Emerging markets have voiced concern about the possibility and timing of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve but a G-20 communique from a meeting of finance chiefs in Turkey will not urge the US central bank against such moves, a delegate said on Friday,"" Reuters reported.

About monetary policy in Japan. Japan is among the developed nations employing ultra-easy monetary policy in its effort to stimulate growth and inflation. Right now, the International Monetary Fund does not see a need for the Bank of Japan to be any easier than it already is.

1105,"""U.S. and European management teams usually are concerned about money, their CEOs only work for money. But Taiwanese are more concerned about a sense of mission and emotional factors.""-Stan Shih, founder, Acer

Acer CEO Jason Chen quickly shot down market talk of a merger between Asus and Acer by noting that the combined market share of the two tech firms is 70% in Taiwan. Thus, a merger between the two firms would violate Fair Trade laws in the country. Acer founder Stan Shih said a few days ago, that he would be open to a takeover of his company in light of its dropping stock price.Acer's stock price has dropped by 50% since April. For the first six months of this year, the company reported a net profit of $5.4 million USD versus a profit of $15 million USD reported during the same period a year earlier. For July, revenue declined 33% year-over-year.While Shih did say that he would welcome a takeover of his company, his comments were an empty gesture. He added that anyone buying Acer would end up paying a lot of money for an empty shell since current management would quit, meaning that the acquiring company would have paid a lot of money for something of no value.source: DigiTimes"
1614,"SILVER VALLEY - Harold Parrish is the eighth Silver Valley Civitan member who has received the International Honor Key since the club's beginning in 1959.

Parrish, 68, said it was a total surprise to receive the highest honor awarded by the Civitan International. He has been a part of the local club since 1975.

“It surprised me,” he said. “It just floored me. It makes your head swell. We're all good people. We try to do good for the handicapped, our neighbors and anybody down on their luck. Love your neighbor as you love yourself.”

The award goes to Civitans who exemplify the highest level of leadership through club, district and international offices. It's also given to those who contribute to the growth of the organization. A committee submitted Parrish's name for consideration.

Brenda Everhart, president of the Silver Valley Civitan Club, said the committee chose Parrish because of all the work he has done in the club. There are 31 members in the local club.

“He always delegates himself to help whether he's on a committee or not,” she said. “He's very encouraging. I thought we made a really good choice. I think it's awesome we picked him. I just think he's an awesome person.”

Over the years, Parrish has received several accolades from the organization such as Family of the Year, Civitan of the Year and a 25-year award for his service. His favorite part about being a Civitan is the fellowship with others in the community. He noted Project Santa is one of the biggest projects where the members provide gifts for needy families and senior citizens.

He really enjoys working with individuals with disabilities through the club. Parrish said the group puts on dances, hosts fishing tournaments, volunteers with Special Olympics and holds several events for the special population.

“I love it all,” he said. “It's about helping your neighbor. It doesn't matter who they are. It's an honorary club. It's the next thing to your church.”

The Central Davidson High School graduate is a U.S. Army veteran who fought in the Vietnam War. He retired six years ago as a supervisor at the furniture wholesaler Pilot View Woodworks in High Point. He's also very active at Denton Chapel United Methodist Church.

His wife of 48 years, Joyce Parrish, joined the Civitan club about 15 years ago. She was a teacher assistant at Silver Valley Elementary School for 34 years before retiring.

They have two children – Amelia Parrish and Amanda (Allen) Surratt – and two grandchildren – Beckham, 7, and Reed 2. Amelia Parrish also received the Outstanding Citizen Award from the local club for her support and help with fundraisers.

“I was so excited. He deserved it. He's always helping people out. He's always willing to help,"" Joyce Parrish said.

2272,"A mistake by Air Canada in offering a package of flights at just 10 per cent of the value has triggered a proposed class-action lawsuit by customers who thought they got an amazing deal.

Court documents, filed in both Quebec and British Columbia, stated the flight pass was offered between Aug. 25 and Aug. 28 at just under $800, but customers were told days later the cost of 10 one-way business-class flights in the western U.S. or Canada was actually $8,000.

The documents said Air Canada refused to live up to its contractual obligations and illegally removed the flight passes.

Garrett Munroe, a lawyer with Munroe and Company, the B.C. firm behind the legal action, said the lawsuit could involve thousands of people, but only Air Canada knows exactly how many people purchased the deal.

""Our view here is that Air Canada has made an enforceable contract, it delivered the flight packages to consumers and it has improperly taken them away,"" he said in an interview.

""Air Canada is duty bound and legally obligated to honour its bargain.""

Nothing has been proven in court.

Air Canada spokeswoman Angela Mah wouldn't comment on the lawsuit but released a previous statement that said a ""computer-loading error"" was responsible for the ""temporary mispricing.""

""Air Canada has contacted purchasers to apologize and provided a refund,"" the statement said.

The airline said any flights already booked with the pass would be honoured.

But Munroe said they want the courts to force Air Canada to live up to its original bargain.

""They say it's a mistake, but how much recklessness is reasonable in terms of allowing the website to show an offer that they don't intend to be bound by,"" he said.

""It would create a significant amount of confusion and uncertainty in the marketplace if consumers were conducting business with the possibility that the merchant is going to come back and attempt to undo the deal that it made.""

It was an attractive price and people bought the package expecting to be able to use it, he said.

""It shouldn't be up to the consumer to second-guess the merchant's motivations in advertising a particular product for sale at a particular price.""

The next step is to ask the courts in both provinces to certify the class-action lawsuit that would represent all those who ask to be part of it.

""Rather than having tens-of-thousands of lawsuits, it can be dealt with as one,"" Munroe noted.

Even if Air Canada decided to honour the agreements for the same price now, that doesn't take care of the legal action because the consumer has lost out on potentially planned trips, he said."
1561,"Natural gas driller Samson Resources is planning to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy by August 15, when a $110 million interest payment comes due on $2.25 billion of senior unsecured junk bonds, reported, citing “two people with knowledge of the matter.” Samson doesn’t have the money, can’t pay, and won’t pay.

The 9.75% bonds maturing February 2020 aren’t traded anymore. The last trade was on July 29 for a quarter of a cent on the dollar. They’re part of the vast high-yield bond pile, and they have become worthless. These kinds of bonds are nicknamed “junk” for a reason.

Stockholders – private equity firms, the ultimate “smart money” – are getting wiped out too.

Samson was acquired in 2011 by a KKR-led group of private equity firms for $7.2 billion. They invested $4.1 billion of equity in the deal. Debt piled on the company made up the rest. Then Samson went on to drill this cash into the ground to produce lots of natural gas and sell it below cost, losing money all along. Now its cash is running out, and new cash to drill into the ground isn’t readily forthcoming.

In the pre-packaged bankruptcy filing, these stockholders would lose their equity stakes in the company, and their shares would become worthless.

Then there are the holders of $1 billion of second-lien covenant-lite term loans. “Covenant-lite” because the debt doesn’t provide creditors the classic protections. During the credit bubble, purposefully constructed by the Fed via its zero-interest rate policy, yield-hungry investors take on just about any risk to earn a discernable yield. Borrowers gobble up the fresh cash and set the terms. And when realty hits, this “covenant-lite” debt leaves investors twisting in the wind.

Holders of these second-lien covenant-lite term loans won’t get their money back either. But their proposal to restructure the company in court and gain control over the company is beating out a competing proposal by holders of the $2.25 billion of unsecured junk bonds that are now going up in smoke.

Relatively unscathed will be a group of lenders, led by JPMorgan, which holds a $1 billion revolving line of credit. In the spring, it granted Samson a waiver for an expected covenant breach to avert default. But the group reduced the size of the revolver. Last year, the same group had already reduced the credit line down from $1.8 billion and had waived a covenant breach.

This act of gradually turning off the cash spigot, this principle by banks to whittle down the size of the loan as the company runs deeper into trouble, is what S&P Capital IQ “Liquidity death spiral.”

It starts when the most secured lenders – banks whose regulators are softly breathing down their necks – get the willies. And it eventually ends in bankruptcy.

Just to get through the bankruptcy proceedings and keep operating, Samson needs new cash to drill into the ground. Natural gas prices are still wallowing below the cost of production, and oil prices have re-plunged, with WTI approaching $43 a barrel. At these prices, fracking remains cash-flow negative. It’s just a matter of time before the new money is gone too.

And yet, according to Bloomberg, “The company is talking with loan holders led by Silver Point Capital LP and Cerberus Capital Management LP to iron out details on a proposal that would give the company a loan of about $300 million to fund operations during Chapter 11 proceedings….”

Surely, that new $300 million loan will offer a hefty yield, and it won’t be covenant-lite, but will come with protections that prior lenders can only dream of.

If the details can’t be worked out by August 15, Samson will default on the $110 million interest payment due that day and use its 30-day grace period to continue the horse-trading with its creditors.

Samson isn’t the first natural gas producer to hit the money wall, but it’s the biggest one: Quicksilver Resources filed Chapter 11 in March, listing $2.35 billion in debts and only $1.21 billion in assets. The rest was drilled into the ground to never be seen again.

Back in March, after Samson had already threatened it might resort to bankruptcy to restructure its debt, Moody’s downgraded the company to Caa3, belatedly invoked “a high risk of default,” and pointed at the real reasons for the fiasco, “chronically low natural gas prices.”

Because fracking is expensive, and fracking profitably and in a cash-flow positive manner requires natural gas prices that are much higher than the prices that have been prevailing for the past six years since fracking took off to create the natural gas “glut.”

Industry soothsayers have claimed over the years – and some still claim – that natural gas drillers can make money at these prices due to new technologies and efficiencies. And they have fancy charts and diagrams to support their claims. They say this to attract new money so that it too can be drilled into the ground to keep the charade going for as long as possible.

But Samson and Quicksilver are proof that natural gas producers have been drilling below the cost of production for years, that they’d been bleeding cash every step along the way, and that the cash is gone for good.

This business model can last only as long as new investors are willing to bail out existing investors. Now all eyes are on other natural-gas-focused drillers, particularly Chesapeake, the second largest natural-gas driller in the US, behind Exxon, and on whether or not these drillers can continue to get fresh money to keep the charade going. When their bonds start selling off – and they have – it’s a sign that bond investors fear that banks are getting the willies and might trigger the “liquidity death spiral.”

2206,"A $2 billion Front Range hospital system crossed one of the nation’s biggest health insurance brands when it freshened up its logo and added a splash of blue.

Broomfield-based Sisters of Charity of Leavenworth Health System (SCL Health) this week sued the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association (BCBS) in U.S. District Court, hoping a judge will give it the rights to its updated blue and green logo painted on hospitals and clinics after a year of legal wrangling.

SCL Health also claims in the suit that BCBS – a federation of 36 independently owned and operated insurance companies including Anthem in Denver – is threatening to remove SCL’s facilities from the Blue Cross Blue Shield network. In Denver, that could mean Anthem customers would likely pay more for care if they went to an SCL facility, such as St. Joseph’s.

SCL Health brought in $2.4 billion in revenue in 2014 and operates facilities in Colorado, Kansas and Wyoming with 12,400 full-time workers.

SCL first adopted the cross with a superimposed heart in the mid-1970s, the suit claims. In 2014, it added a shade of blue and filed an application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office to register the new logo, according to the lawsuit.

In February of 2015, the suit claims, “BCBS demanded that SCL Health discontinue using the color blue within the Updated Heart and Cross Logo – stating that SCL Health should consider ‘transitioning to a color other than blue of its cross mark.’”

BCBS also filed a notice of opposition with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, claiming that the SCL Health’s new logo violates its trademarked blue cross logo. SCL Health shot back in further filings with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.

In an email from a BCBS lawyer from June included in the lawsuit filing, the BCBS Association said its ownership rights and registrations include not just its full logo, but also the solid blue cross symbol, and extend beyond the health insurance market.

“These incontestable registrations cover not only insurance services, but also healthcare delivery services that have been found to be related and confusing similar to services offered by hospitals,” the letter states.

“In addition to the above concerns regarding the BDC Programs, BCBSA has a duty and great desire to prevent its marks from dilution and likelihood of confusion.”

A few months later, the suit claims, BCBS threatened SCL Health and said if the logo matter was not resolved, including claims with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, “BCBS Association would terminate all existing payer relationships with SCL Health; would terminate all existing Blue Distinction Center relationships with SCL Health, and would never again undertake a commercial relationship of any sort with SCL Health.”

That would lead to lower revenue at SCL Health and patient hardships, the suit claims.

A spokesman for BCBS said the organization cannot comment on pending litigation.

Kathryn Reilly, a lawyer with Wheeler Trigg O’Donnell in Denver who filed the case for SCL Health, declined to comment when reached by phone."

2142,"The long slow demise of U.S. Investigations Services Inc. may finally be over now that the company and its parent, Altegrity, have agreed to settle False Claims Act allegations with Justice Department.

Interestingly, the settlement doesn’t call for USIS to pay the government anything. Instead, USIS and Altegrity are giving up their right to collect payments that they claim are owed the company by the Office of Personnel Management. The agreement doesn’t include any kind of admission of guilt on the part of USIS.

The agreement also doesn’t settle on any payment to Blake Percival, a former USIS executive, who filed a False Claims Act lawsuit that the Justice Department later joined. Percival’s fraud accusations included charges the company was passing on incomplete background investigations to the government that they knew were not complete. USIS was the largest provider of background investigations to the federal government.

When the allegations came to light, Altegrity brought in a new management team and revamped its processes. The company has maintained that it always has cooperated with the Justice Department’s investigation.

But pressure increased on the company after Edward Snowden’s NSA leaks. USIS conducted Snowden’s background investigation. The company also did a background investigation on Aaron Alexis, a contractor who went on a shooting spree at the Navy Yard in 2013, killing 13 people.

In 2014, the company, already struggling financially, was hit with a breach of its networks. OPM terminated USIS’ contracts instead of renewing them. The move effectively put USIS out of business. It laid off nearly 2,000 people.

Altegrity sold a remaining national security professional services business to PAE in early 2015. Altegrity also filed for bankruptcy.

The settlement is part of a broader settlement that resolves other matters involving Altegrity’s bankruptcy proceedings, according to the Justice Department announcement.

The only remaining issue is how much Percival’s share of the settlement will be. Generally, whistleblower payments are in the 15 percent to 20 percent range, so Percival might see a payment measured in the millions.

But given that USIS is giving up a claim and not paying a fine, I’m not sure where Percival’s payment will come from. Would the government cut him a check for $4 million or $5 million? I don’t know.

But rightly or wrongly, USIS is now relegated to history."
1385,"Agrawal's shuttered soybean plant highlights the malaise gripping Indian crushers, who have been forced to use a fraction of their capacity as the domestic market stays awash with cheap rival palm oil from top producers Malaysia and Indonesia.

Now with Malaysian palm oil prices near 6-1/2 year lows, imports could rise even more, undermining Prime Minister Narendra Modi's efforts to make the country self-sufficient in edible oils, overseas purchases of which exceed $10 billion per year - India's third-highest such spend after oil and gold.

""In the next year, palm oil imports could rise up to 10 million tonnes from around 9.3 million tonnes this year. At the current price level other oils can't compete with palm oil,"" said Nitesh Shahra, president of the refinery division of Ruchi Soya, the country's biggest edible oil refiner.

""Already our import dependency has gone up from 30 percent to nearly 70 percent in the last few years. It will go up further unless we make oilseeds remunerative for farmers by increasing import duty,"" he added.

Massive imports have driven down Indian soybean prices by 20 percent in four months, discouraging farmers from expanding oilseed area. But despite this, local soyoil is still 50 percent costlier than imported palm oil.

""Oilseed cultivation is not profitable. There is no guarantee of prices and yield,"" said Mukesh Patel, who cultivates soybeans in Dewas, a district in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. ""Next year I will switch to corn. It costs less and gives better returns,"" he added.

In the past 20 years, India's edible oil output has risen only about a third whereas imports have surged twelve times to 14.4 million tonnes to keep pace with growing consumption, making it the world's top buyer of cooking oils.

While India does have a crushing capacity of more than 30 million tonnes, utilization is at below 30 percent due to a scarcity of oilseeds, said Pravin Lunkad, president of industry body the Solvent Extractors' Association of India. Earlier this year crushing plants were operating at around 45 to 50 percent.

""India has become the dumping ground for palm oil,"" said Davish Jain, chairman of the Soybean Processors Association of India. ""Our oilseed and edible oil production will not rise unless we restrict cheaper imports.""

The finance ministry is looking into requests for a hike in import duties on crude edible oils to 25 percent from 7.5 percent, and to 45 percent on the refined variety from 15 percent, government sources said.

India has said it plans to spend $1.5 billion over three years to help farmers grow oil palm trees. It has already been considering directly buying oilseeds from farmers and boosting state support for rapeseed, soybeans and peanuts.

But as of now, it is a Catch-22 for farmers and millers.

""We can't sell edible oils at higher prices due to cheaper imports and oilseed farmers are not ready to accept lower prices,"" said the miller Agrawal."
1398,"Achuar communities shut down 11 wells and took control of an airdrome in oil block 8 to demand clean water, reparations for oil pollution and more pay for the use of native land, said Carlos Sandi, chief of the indigenous federation Feconaco.

Argentine energy firm Pluspetrol, which operates block 8, said daily output of about 8,500 barrels per day had stopped. The company urged protesters in block 8 to seek dialogue.

""So far, however, they insist on holding control of installations,"" Pluspetrol said in a statement.

Sandi said the Achuar in oil block 192 would soon seize wells there following a dispute with the government over proceeds for communities in a new contract awarded to Pacific Exploration and Production Corporation.

Both oil blocks are in Peru's northern region of Loreto.

""The decision (to seize wells) has been made, we just need to wrap up some coordinations,"" Sandi said.

Peru signed a last-minute deal with Pacific for the rights to tap oil block 192 for the next two years after an open auction for a 30-year contract failed to draw any bids last month.

The government included benefits for some indigenous communities in the new contract but a stalemate with others over their share of oil profits left many out.

Representatives of Pacific could not be reached outside of regular business hours.

Pluspetrol previously operated block 192, which produces about 12,000 barrels per day.

Native protesters have halted output from block 192 several times in recent years to demand the government clean up spills and give them more compensation. Peru has declared several environmental emergencies there because of oil pollution.

Peru is rife with conflicts over mining and energy projects. The South American country is a relatively small oil producer and imports crude to meet local demand."
1760,"Commodity currency traders take note – it’s not the individual commodity prices that you should be watching but broader commodity price indices.

That’s the view of Emma Lawson, senior FX strategist at the NAB, who, in a fantastic Friday morning note, suggest that traders “should be watching commodity sentiment, not particular commodities, for a daily guide on forex movements”.

Lawson looked at the drivers of currencies such as the Australian, New Zealand and Canadian dollars, along with the Norwegian krone. While all have one dominant commodity export – iron ore for Australia, milk solids for New Zealand and oil in the case of the CAD and NOK – they discovered that “in an analysis of the relationship between the commodity currencies and the price of their main export, historically, the individual price was not the best predictor of changes in the currency”.

After analysing daily changes in the commodity currencies against the USD, and on a trade weighted (TW) basis, Lawson discovered that “the strongest relationships were with the broad market indexes, be it the CRB index or the London Metals Exchange index (LMEX)”.

She notes that regardless of the commodity currency, the result was “surprisingly consistent”.

Based on her findings, Lawson believes that traders should not be looking at iron ore, dairy or oil prices as a given, but rather the broad commodity complex and the general market sentiment on commodities.

“This adds to the belief that the ‘commodity currencies’ indeed trade as a group rather than their own individual complexities in the short term”, she notes.

For the Australian and New Zealand dollars, Lawson suggest the CRB index is a “modestly stronger” influence when evaluating movements against the US dollar, although, on a trade-weighted basis, the LMEX has a slightly stronger relationship.

“These results suggest that for the AUD in particular, we should be less focussed on the daily change in iron ore prices but gauging the more broad market sentiment on commodities,” she says.

So where does that leave the outlook for the Australian dollar? While Australia’s goods terms of trade are expected to decline very modestly from current levels in their opinion, NAB modeling suggests the AUD/USD is already around fair value, with present value modeling suggesting it is perhaps even slightly undervalued.

“Our Present Value model, which estimate the expected present value for AUD/USD based on interest rate differentials, LMEX and risk appetite (VIX), suggest that there may be very modest upward pressure to around 0.74. From here, the bigger likely driver of this model is from market volatility and interest rate differentials, rather than commodities. Our Fair Value Model, which uses the goods terms of trade as a key input, also shows that the AUD is, at present, around fair value. All up, the pressure on the AUD remains to the downside from the commodity complex, but the outlook is for a little less downside than has been seen over the last few years. The worst is behind us, from this source at least”.

At present the AUD/USD trades at .6994, the lowest level seen since April 2009."

1966,"First they lost their land. Now, they have lost their money too. Some 400 families of Odisha’s coastal Jagatsinghpur district whose land were acquired for the proposed Posco steel plant have been cheated by Ponzi scheme operators of the money they had received from the government as compensation in lieu of their land.

Sunakar Swain, 63, is one such who feels he has been victimised twice over. He got Rs 5 lakh compensation after the government some years ago seized his two betel vines, of which he invested Rs 3 lakh with the Artha Tatwa (AT) group, one of Odisha’s biggest chit fund companies then. The company has since run aground, leaving thousands of investors like Swain distraught and in financial ruin.

“I did not get any return… I have got completely ruined financially as the rest compensation amount exhausted within a year,” Swain said. What he earns today from his new fish business is too little for his large family of eight.

When Posco signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Odisha government in 2005 to start a Rs 12 million steel plant, it faced stiff resistance from residents of eight villages affected by the project. Villagers were reluctant to part either with their land and their traditional means of livelihood. However, by 2013, 2,700 acres of land was acquired and those whose land were seized were given a cash compensation.

In Nuagaon and Gakakujanga panchayats, locals received a compensation of about Rs 9 crores against their 651 betel vines demolished in 2011.

But barely educated, few had little clue about safe investments and fell prey to chit fund firms that were thriving across the state then. Akshay Kumar Sethi, 45, lost more than half of his compensation amount of Rs 3 lakh to AT group and is now jobless. “We were swayed by local political leaders’ association with the chit fund companies. The leaders inaugurated the branch offices of the companies lending credibility to them,” he said.

A host of chit fund companies swindled about Rs 4,300 crores from people in Odisha. AT group was one of the biggest. The others who allegedly swindled thousands and whose owners are now in the dock include groups such as Seashore and Naba Diganta.

1467,"Just one short year ago, Texas drilling country rumbled with activity and high expectations that the good times would last a long while.

So much for that.

Amid a plunge in oil prices, the bonanza has paused at the very least, wiping out thousands of jobs in the oilfields and communities dependent on them.



A barrel of West Texas crude is selling near $40 these days, the lowest since 2009, when Texas was struggling to shake the effects of the global financial crisis. The state lost nearly 340,000 jobs that year, and its unemployment rate skyrocketed to levels unseen in more than two decades.

Though anything can happen in the volatile world of oil trading, all signs point to a downturn that will be longer than many expected – including state revenue estimators.

But state officials aren’t sweating. The phenomenon has undoubtedly walloped oil-dependent communities in South and West Texas. But across the rest of the state, other business sectors are picking up the slack for an industry that no longer dominates the economy. And increases in production have kept oil and gas taxes flowing into Austin for now, even as prices drop.

“The comptroller does not want to diminish the impact that this has had on people’s communities and people’s lives,” said Chris Bryan, a spokesman for Comptroller Glenn Hegar.

“You’re still seeing job growth, you’re still seeing revenue growth in sales tax, you’re still seeing people moving here,” he said. “And I think that is part of that story of Texas being not just an oil and gas state anymore.”

The stats back up the comptroller. The state economy is growing, though more slowly than it did amid the drilling boom.

In March, the state lost 25,400 jobs, ending a remarkable streak of 53 months of growth, according to state and federal data. Yet Texas turned around and added 33,200 jobs in May, and added more in each month since.

Last June, the state collected less sales tax revenue than it did in June of 2014, ending a 62-month growth streak. But in July, it edged out collections from a year earlier.

Oil and mineral-related revenue makes up 10 percent of the state’s total tax collections but less than five percent of the Texas budget, according to state records.

“The revenue estimate is the sum of various parts, and what we’re seeing with oil and gas is, it’s not doing real well, but the other parts are doing very well,” said Dale Craymer, president of the business-backed Texas Taxpayers and Research Association and a former revenue estimator in the comptroller’s office.

But in January, Hegar’s revenue estimate pegged taxable oil prices at between $65 and $75 per barrel through 2017. That’s far above where they are now, and far above where experts now expect them to linger, as supply stays high here and abroad and a mix of geopolitical factors – including a diplomatic breakthrough that could unlock Iran’s supply – threaten to keep it that way.

Last week, the federal Energy Information Administration lowered its price forecasts for the coming years. The agency now predicts that per-barrel prices will average $49 in 2015 and $54 the next year.

Does that portend budget trouble in Texas?  Not necessarily, the comptroller and other experts say. So far, oil tax revenue has come in around where Hegar predicted, largely because Texas operators are pumping more oil than expected.

Wells drilled today produce far more oil than the conventionally drilled wells of years past (though the output of those wells trails off more rapidly). Operators now drill multiple wells on one site, and the rigs themselves are more efficient. Plummeting prices have only further driven operators to find new ways to eke out a profit margin.

Texas oil production was still rising through May, according to the most recent figures published by the state Railroad Commission, which regulates oil and gas.

“Today, we’re producing three times the oil we did 20 years ago,” Craymer said.  “We’ve got low prices on a much higher production base than we’ve had historically, so that might give us a cushion as well.”

Still, experts forecast even more layoffs and declining investment in the coming months — resulting in lower production — as contracts that were signed before the prices tanked expire.

That means less spending on equipment and other goods in the oil patch, taking a bite out of state sales taxes.

“We have had a very healthy economy and that’s help delay the impact of falling oil prices, but I think we’re still going to see even slower growth ahead than what we are currently experiencing,” said Craymer.

With that in mind, the comptroller's office is still keeping a close eye on oil prices, and has an opportunity to revise its forecasts in the coming months as it certifies its revenue estimate – a process that takes into account the legislature’s most recent actions.

“This is an opportunity to look at everything again,” said Bryan.

But even if that revision proves overly optimistic, the Texas budget may still escape trouble, because lawmakers left more $6.4 billion unspent in the budget Gov. Greg Abbott signed in June.

“The question is,” said LeBas, “is the state going to stay in the black, and the answer there is yes.”

2098,"Independent monitor Thomas Perrelli released his third report this year giving details of Citigroup Inc.’s progress in complying with a settlement valued at $2.5 billion.

Citigroup agreed to Perrelli’s appointment as part of the settlement.

The settlement resolved issues from the days before the financial crisis of 2008, addressing allegations that the bank sold defective residential mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations in 2006 and 2007. Citigroup settled on July 11, 2014, with the U.S. Justice Department and five states, agreeing to pay $4.5 billion to the governments.

The bank also agreed to remedial measures, promising $2.5 billion in consumer relief, according to a summary of the first monitor’s report prepared by Perrelli in January. The relief was to include loan modification for so-called underwater homeowners, down payment and closing cost assistance, and subordinate financing for affordable rental housing projects.

The ongoing nature of that relief would require monitoring. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, “any cost associated” with the monitor “shall be borne by Citigroup.”

Perrelli, a partner at Jenner & Block LLP’s Washington office and a former associate attorney general, has been measuring the bank’s progress in consumer credit relief, investments in affordable housing and consumer outreach.

The new report follows reports released in January and May.

Perrelli found that Citigroup provided $95.2 million in relief for the period ended March 31. He also confirmed the credit the bank sought for mortgage relief under the agreement in amount of $29.7 million. Transactions relating to so-called gap financing for affordable housing were submitted by Citigroup. Perrelli is still reviewing them, according to the report.

“We are pleased with our progress under the terms of the settlement agreement,” Mark Rodgers, a company spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. “Citi remains committed to assisting distressed borrowers in their efforts to avoid potential foreclosure.”

Guilty Plea in Fraud Scheme on Law Firms, NJLJ Says

Martin Feliz, 48, admitted to using fake litigation-support companies to bilk law firms of more than $7 million, the New Jersey Law Journal reported.

Feliz pleaded guilty to tax evasion and conspiracy to commit wire fraud last week in federal court in Newark.

The conspiracy charge carries a prison sentence of as long as 20 years and a maximum fine of $250,000. The tax-evasion charge could bring five years in prison and a $250,000 fine, the newspaper said.

Feliz admitted that he created two limited-liability companies that submitted invoices to a law firm where his wife, Kiela Ravelo, worked. The invoices didn’t reflect real work, prosecutors said.

Prosecutors said Ravelo approved the invoices, according to the paper. A charge of conspiracy to commit wire fraud against her “is pending,” the paper reported.

“Until today, Ms. Ravelo had hoped and prayed that Feliz would take full responsibility for his actions, by publicly proclaiming, as he has consistently told his family, that Ms. Ravelo acted as Feliz coercively demanded,” Stephen Sadow, a lawyer for Ravelo, told the newspaper. “He has caved to government pressure to implicate her.”

Squire Patton Boggs US LLP’s M&A partner Abby Brown led the team that represented Steritech Group in a deal to be acquired by Rentokil Initial Plc.

The $425 million all-cash agreement will create one of the largest pest-control providers in the U.S., according to an e-mailed statement by the law firm. The agreement is subject to regulatory approval.

Completing the transaction will make Rentokil the third-largest pest-control company in Canada and the U.S., the company said in a statement.

Charlotte, North Carolina-based Steritech provides “environmentally friendly pest elimination,” the company said on its website.

Brown, who is based in Washington, was assisted by partners Jonathan Pavony, M&A; Sean Clancy, tax; Carl Draucker, benefits; Jill Kirila, employment; Russ Randle, environmental; and Anthony Swisher, antitrust; as well as principal Stacy Krumin, real estate; and counsel Ivan Rothman, intellectual property.

1151,"Michel Combes, CEO of French telecommunications equipment manufacturer, Alcatel-Lucent, has been called upon by the French government and unions to renounce reported bonuses in the vicinity of €14 million.

The French-based company only has a few months left before it ceases trading as Alcatel-Lucent and instead takes on its new moniker, Nokia Corporation. Both Alcatel-Lucent and Finnish communications giant Nokia entered into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) earlier this year in a €15.6 billion deal that will see both companies merge by early 2016.

Combes, who has headed the French-American company since 2013, will allegedly step down once the merger goes ahead.

On Sunday, French newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche, citing official documents and current share values, said Combes could receive almost €14 million in bonuses over three years.

""It is quite rightly causing controversy,"" the spokesman for the Socialist government, Stephane Le Foll, told reporters.

""[The size of any such bonus] is always political at a time when we are emerging from what is a difficult crisis for a lot of French people"".

He called on Combes to reflect on the bonus.

Alcatel-Lucent defended Combes saying he has multiplied by six times the value of the company, and saved it from bankruptcy.

It said the amount he is due to receive is not linked to his departure and that the share payout is due to the success of the firm's tie-up with Nokia.

Since his arrival, Combes has overseen a recovery plan that has tripled its share value but led to the loss of 10,000 jobs.

The CFE-CGC union said he ""should have the grace to renounce most of the bonuses"" as he had instituted a ""recovery plan of unprecedented violence"".

Last month, the European Commission gave the proposed merger the green light, reporting it had found no cause for concern with the deal going ahead, citing the limited overlap between the two company's product sets and markets.

In June, the US Justice Department gave the amalgamation a nod, with Nokia confirming the merger has also been cleared by antitrust authorities in Albania, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Russia, and Serbia.

""Both companies will continue to cooperate with the remaining authorities to close their reviews as quickly as possible,"" Nokia said.

""The merger still remains subject to approval by Nokia shareholders, Nokia holding over 50 percent of the share capital of Alcatel-Lucent on a fully diluted basis upon completion of the public exchange offer, receipt of other regulatory approvals and other customary conditions.""

Dubbed the company's last deal before the merger, Alcatel-Lucent signed two separate agreements in July with China Mobile and China Unicom, that will see networking upgrades for the telecommunications providers at a combined cost of 8.12 billion yuan.

Nokia also announced last week it had signed an MOU with Chinese investment firm, China Hauxin. Under the MOU, Nokia will hold 50 percent plus one share of a joint venture that combines Nokia's infrastructure businesses in China and Alcatel-Lucent Shanghai Bell.

Nokia and Huaxin intend to use the proposed joint venture to speed up regulatory approval of the merger in China.

""With this MOU now in place, we will also work closely with our new partners to make the case for swift approval of the proposed combination between Nokia and Alcatel-Lucent by the appropriate Chinese authorities,"" Nokia chief and president Rajeev Suri said."

1658,"Retired miner Tadeusz Slowikowski, 84, heard from a German man in the 1970s of a train that left the German city of Breslau (today Poland’s Wroclaw) in the spring of 1945, as the Soviet army approached. He said the man told him the train disappeared before ever making it to Waldenburg (now Wroclaw) some 65 kilometers (45 miles) to the west.

WALBRZYCH, Poland (AP) — The placid woodlands around this medieval castle town have suddenly become the hottest spot in Poland — as treasure hunters descend on the area in search of a mystery Nazi train said to be laden with gold.

Government reports that two men may have located the legendary World War II treasure, purportedly buried in a secret tunnel in the bowels of the earth, have set off a frenzy of excitement among fortune-hunters from across Poland and beyond.

""It's a true gold rush,"" said Andrzej Nowak, a 60-year-old retired teacher who lives near the spot.

Polish authorities recently said that two men, whose names they have not been released, used radar to locate an armored train deep under the woodlands around Walbrzych, and believe it could be the so-called Nazi ""gold train."" Rumors have swirled for decades about the train, also said to be filled with weapons, though there is absolutely no evidence that it ever existed.

A government official said last week that the claimants' theory is based on the ""deathbed testimony"" of one of the men who allegedly helped load the train at the end of the war.

On one recent day, the normally quiet area was swarming with tourists, journalists and locals. Nowak, who himself has joined the treasure hunt, said he has seen cars with plates from across Poland, Germany, the Netherlands and elsewhere.

""Have you found it?"" people keep saying to each other — mostly in a joking spirit. For it's highly unlikely that any amateur treasure hunter will stumble across the train: If it exists, it will be buried deep in the ground, within a labyrinth of tunnels the Nazis built during the war, probably accessible only with the help of massive machinery and explosives.

If the train and its treasures eventually do turn up, it will belong to the Polish state. The two claimants are demanding 10 percent of the value of the find, something officials have said they will get. Serious excavation work is expected to start within weeks.

Meanwhile, the Polish military is moving in for a fact-finding mission. And police are patrolling the area around the clock, to prevent any attempts at secret digging, or other tampering with the site, or obstructing the railway traffic.

The man considered the main living source of the legend is following the excitement from his home just a few kilometers (miles) away. Retired miner Tadeusz Slowikowski, 84, heard from a German man in the 1970s of a train that left the German city of Breslau (today Poland's Wroclaw) in the spring of 1945, as the Soviet army approached. He said the man told him the train disappeared before ever making it to Waldenburg (now Walbrzych) some 65 kilometers (45 miles) to the west.

""I have lived with this mystery for 40 years, but each time I went to the authorities they always silenced it,"" Slowikowski told The Associated Press in an interview in his home. ""For so many years! Unbelievable!""

He said he is ""very grateful"" that the two men have finally ""revealed this mystery to the public.""

Slowikowski said he knows them, and that they have been to his home to tap his knowledge. Aside from his memories, he keeps prewar German maps of the area, current photographs and a model that he built of the spot where he believes the train disappeared. One of the men is Polish, and the other a German citizen of Polish origins, he said.

""They are decent people, engineers, but I cannot possibly give their names,"" Slowikowski said.

During the war, the Germans were building headquarters for Hitler in Walbrzych's Ksiaz Castle — then called the Fuerstenstein castle — a majestic structure developed from a medieval fortress that seems to belong in a fairy tale. In the rock below, they were also building a system of tunnels and bunkers, called the Giant Project. Only some of the tunnels have been found.

Slowikowski believes the system included a secret tunnel where the Germans hid the train from the Soviets — and that they blew up the entrance to the tunnel when they saw defeat coming.

In past years he did a lot of digging by railway tracks with a friend, Andrzej Gaik, at the point where he believes the train went missing. In 2001 the two dug through soil and rock and hit what they believe was the supportive wall of a tunnel underground. They were then banned by the railway authorities from excavating further.

""I am glad that these two men reported the find to the authorities,"" said Gaik, a local guide. ""They went a step further than we did. They examined it with ground-penetrating equipment and took this picture. We were not able to afford such equipment.""

To some historians, the entire story of a Nazi gold train is preposterous.

Pawel Rodziewicz, who belongs to a local historical society, said that documentation leaves no doubt that gold in Breslau was evacuated to the German central bank in Berlin and elsewhere, so there would have been no reason to take any to Waldenburg, where the approaching Soviets could find it.

He thinks it impossible that a secret railway tunnel could have been built into the hill near railroad tracks in frequent use. No documents have ever been found to indicate such a project was undertaken, while documents exist even for the most top-secret projects of the Third Reich, including some for the subterranean tunnels beneath the Ksiaz Castle.

But last week, a deputy culture minister, Piotr Zuchowski, said from Warsaw that he was ""certain"" that the train has been found, though the next day he changed that to ""99 percent"" sure.

Local authorities, meanwhile, are expressing more caution. Arkadiusz Grudzien, a spokesman for the Walbrzych mayor, says the city sees only a ""degree of probability"" about a possible discovery.

Time will tell: The Defense Ministry has ordered explosives experts from the army to the site to begin checking it, warning that the alleged train could be booby-trapped and dangerous. The work is expected to begin in earnest in the next weeks, but army experts are already there this week to examine the site.

Until more is known, amateur sleuths are living a moment of great excitement.

One, Christal Focken from Germany, was roaming the area on Wednesday. She showed The AP an elevated area that rises unexpectedly in the woods — a shape that, to her, seems suspiciously like the shape of a railway tunnel. At the start is a hole with some fractured stones, which she thinks could be the remains of the purported explosion.

""This is a railway tunnel,"" Focken said. ""I don't know if a train is inside. Maybe.""

Meanwhile, local officials welcome the spotlight on a beautiful region with a rich history.

Walbrzych, Grudzien said, is being ""presented as a place of mysteries, of legends, of uncovered facts and tunnels.""

1744,"The Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries (ISRI) is hosting its annual Commodities Roundtable Forum, Sept. 9 to 11, 2015, in Chicago. The event provides a comprehensive view of what is happening across a wide range of recycled commodities, including ferrous and nonferrous metals, recovered paper and plastics, and the key trends affecting the $106 billion scrap recycling industry, ISRI says.

The event features the Special Topic Roundtable on Economy: Looking Beyond China. As China's economy and manufacturing growth have cooled, Chinese demand for scrap commodities from the U.S. has been eroding in the face of falling commodity prices. Amid expectations for rising domestic scrap generation in China and potentially tighter financing requirements and environmental regulations, scrap exporters are increasingly aware of the need to develop new overseas markets, ISRI says. ISRI Chief Economist and Director of Commodities Joe Pickard, along with a panel of experts, discuss the outlook for China and what developing markets are next in line for increased scrap demand growth.

“There is no doubt that there is a high level of uncertainty in the markets right now when it comes to scrap supply and demand,” says Pickard. “The industry is facing extremely challenging conditions both at home and abroad, yet there are still emerging growth opportunities for recyclers. This dynamic should lead to a number of lively discussions at this year’s roundtable.”

ISRI has, once again, assembled a group of expert speakers and moderators to shed light on the key developments and future outlook for global commodity and scrap markets. This year’s lineup includes:

Lawyers in Missouri have filed a class-action lawsuit against the company, with the lead plaintiff being an unnamed woman who reportedly paid a $19 fee to the website in order to permanently scrub her data from its servers, a so-called ""paid delete.""

Experts have offered conflicting opinions on the likely success of legal actions brought against Ashley Madison and its parent companies in the wake of the breach.

In most data breach cases, the plaintiff's biggest hurdle is proving that the users suffered a tangible harm. ""Here, unlike most retail breaches, just the fact that one is exposed as a customer of the site is sensitive, confidential, and potentially damaging information,"" Goodwin Procter partner Brenda Sharton, who chairs the firm's privacy and data security practice, told the Verge.

Other experts, however, suggested that the fact that potential plaintiffs would have to effectively out themselves as customers of the site, would discourage people from coming forward.

""I'd be surprised if you get a lot of traction here,"" Scott Vernick, a partner and head of the data security and privacy practice at the law firm Fox Rothschild LLP, told the AP.

The FBI and Canadian law enforcement agencies are investigating the hack that resulted in the breach of users' data. The hack was reportedly carried out by a group that calls itself The Impact Team. The hackers cite the company's data practices and the immorality of extra-marital affairs as reasons for their actions.

The group released a second trove of data from the site this week, which included emails sent by Noel Biderman, founder and CEO of AshleyMadison.com’s parent company Avid Life Media.

AshleyMadison.com, which has the slogan “Life is short – have an affair,” reportedly has over 30 million members worldwide."
2115,"A security guard who was injured during an air show can pursue a lawsuit against the company that operated the event despite previously receiving workers compensation benefits from her employer, a Florida appellate court has ruled.

Alice Slora worked for U.S. Security Associates Inc., which provided event security at a March 2011 Polk County, Florida, air show operated by Sun 'n Fun Fly-In Inc., court records show.

A tornado hit during the show, overturning the security guard shack Ms. Slora was in and causing her to sustain injuries, according to records.

She filed a claim for workers compensation benefits and settled with U.S. Security, records show.

In August 2013, Ms. Slora filed a negligence claim in the Circuit Court for Polk County against Sun 'n Fun Fly-In, according to records. She alleged that the tornado was foreseeable, and that the company “failed to maintain the guard shack in a reasonably safe condition and to warn invitees of the risks of injury from foul weather.”

Sun 'n Fun argued that the workers comp benefits provided to Ms. Slora by U.S. Security were the exclusive remedy for her injuries and that immunity is extended to a contractor, records show.

The Circuit Court found that certificates of waiver issued to Sun 'n Fun by the Federal Aviation Administration established a “contractual relationship,” according to records. The court granted summary judgment in favor of Sun 'n Fun, as the FAA required the company to provide security at the air show, among other conditions, and that the contractual relationship entitled Sun 'n Fun to immunity as a matter of law.

Ms. Slora appealed, and on Wednesday a unanimous three-judge panel of Florida's 2nd District Court of Appeal reversed the ruling and remanded the case for further proceedings.

To be entitled to immunity, Sun 'n Fun needed to show it had a “contractual obligation” to the FAA, and that it “delegated or sublet” part of that obligation to U.S. Security, the appellate court's ruling states.

However, the certificates of waiver appear to be regulatory permits or licenses — not contracts, which facilitate an exchange of promise between two or more parties for a mutually beneficial purpose, according to the ruling.

“Accordingly, the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment to Sun 'n Fun on the theory that it was immune from tort liability as a 'contractor' under Florida's Workers' Compensation Law,” the ruling states."
1089,"The controversial commenter with the alias of ""Acta Non Verba"", Brian Owendoff, is once again making the headlines as he is now facing a lawsuit filed by Capacity Commercial Group, an Oregon limited liability company, for breach of contract, intentional interference with economic relations, and fraud.

Like Us on Facebook

CCG discovered last June that Owendoff was ""knowingly and willfully soliciting and engaging in professional real estate activity outside of his work for CCG and in violation of the terms of the Agreement."" The company terminated Owendoff from their ranks and demanded payment for the portions of revenues he got from his side deals.

The full complaint filed is available on Oregon Live.

Upon his termination, Owendoff allegedly contacted BDC/NW Irving, LLC, one of CCG's clients, that he would no longer offer them assistance unless they terminate their agreement with CCG.

Owendoff has also begun to send e-mails to CCG to intimidate the company into taking course of action which Owendoff deemed favorable to him.

The alleged e-mails sent by Owendoff to CCG contains some vulgar language such as ""Morally bankrupt clueless lying Mormon dies immediately from bankruptcy & greed. F**K YOU P***Y"". CCG believes that the email was targeting one of its principals who adheres to Mormon faith.

Out of concern for their safety, safety of their employees and their clients, CCG ""reported the above described behavior to the Portland Police Department and contacted Owendoff through legal counsel asking that the emails stop,""

According to Oregon Live, Owendoff made headlines in 2011 after the neighborhood newspaper The Northwest Examiner revealed him to be the man behind ""Acta Non Verba,"" an OregonLive commenter who predicted in one of his more than 200 comments that then-Portland Mayor Sam Adams would end up ""pumping gas at the Chevron.""

1134,"McADOO — The merger of the McAdoo and Keystone fire companies is complete, but the inclusion of the Tresckow Fire Company is still in the works, officials said.

McAdoo fire Chief Bob Leshko said McAdoo and Keystone continue to work on their merger while waiting for Tresckow to follow suit.

“McAdoo and Keystone is done,” Leshko said Saturday. “The court approved that merger June 5. Keystone has been transferred to us. The McAdoo Fire Company Inc. is the parent organization. We are in the process of changing titles and deeds. In September, we will hold nomination of officers. We are planning an open house during Fire Prevention Week in October.”

Banks Township Supervisor Rick Porpiglia — the supervisors’ representative on the merger — said the supervisors are waiting to hear what the next step is from legal counsel.

“The Tresckow Fire Company is still the recognized emergency services provider in the township,” Porpiglia said. “Our emergency services are covered. We won’t do anything until we hear from the lawyer.”

“We are waiting for Tresckow,” Leshko said. “We are waiting for the division of the fire company and social club. Once that is done, the attorney will move to (complete) the merger. Things are looking very positive. We are hoping it will be done by the end of the year.”

The McAdoo Fire Company has had a social club in its original building on West Blaine Street for several years, but it has no impact on the merger. The garage in that structure is used for storage, Leshko said.

McAdoo and Keystone are working to organize themselves better. “We are working to transfer our trailers from Sheridan and East Blaine Street to land near Keystone,” Leshko said. “Through the cooperation of McAdoo Borough, we were able to use the millings from streets to make land flat near Keystone where we can put the trailers. We are not planning a building for them. All apparatus will stay in the same buildings until we build a new building for everybody.”

The names on the fire trucks will also not change yet.

“Once the (three) companies are merged, we will change our name to KMT Emergency Services,” Leshko said. “The name on the apparatus will not be changed until we get new apparatus. This is the most cost-efficient way to do it, because the dollars don’t come as freely as they did in the past.”

Leshko said 2016 will be a big year for the new, merged company. Its annual summer picnic is scheduled for June 18-19, at the fire company’s main building on Kennedy Drive. The McAdoo Fire Company is also hosting the Six-County Firemen’s Convention the following weekend, June 25-26, “in memory of my son, Aaron,” Leshko said. His son died a year ago from a disease that hampered his speech and confined him to a wheelchair.

McAdoo and Hazleton jointly hosted the 2010 convention and parade. The Six-County Firemen’s Association, formed in 1904 in Hazleton, includes companies from Luzerne, Schuylkill, Columbia, Northumberland, Montour and Lackawanna counties.

Leshko said the annual fund drive in McAdoo and Kline Township will be starting very soon.

It would be nice if the entire merger were final for the fund drive, the chief noted.

“One advantage to a merged company is there will be one fund drive,” Leshko said. “We’re hoping if somebody donated $5 to everybody, they will donate $20 to just one company.”

It was hoped with the merger that the new company would be able to draw on a larger manpower pool.

With the merger of McAdoo and Keystone, “Some (firefighters) stayed, and some left. Some were in favor of the merger, some were not,” Leshko said. “We hoped everybody would come over and talk to us.”

Leshko said merger or not, there is still a great need for more volunteers.

“We need more volunteers, not just to fight fires but to help with fund raising and other things,” Leshko said. “There’s a lot more that goes on outside of the firefighting aspect.”

Fundraisers coming up will be their annual food sale the weekend of Sept. 12-13. They will be selling cheesesteaks, chicken cheesesteaks, sausage and pepper hoagies, potato pancakes, halushkie, halupki, bean soup, French fries, pizza and apple pies and apple dumplings.

There will also be a soup and grilled sandwich sale Oct. 16.

“We are planning additional fundraisers. We are talking about making and selling fried bologna and grilled cheesesteak sandwiches,” he said."

1677,"A man who spent 40 years searching for the Nazi gold train has locked his top secret documents in a bank vault after mysterious men tried to break into his home.

Tadeusz Slowikowski, 85, revealed to MailOnline how he first heard about the train which is thought to be laden with gold, looted paintings and even the Amber Chamber back in the 1950s.

Mr Slowikowski said: 'I became aware of the tunnel after saving a German man named Schulz from being attacked by two men. As gratitude for saving him, he told me about the tunnel.'

The story Schulz told him was one of murder, fear and secrets beginning in the dying days of the Second World War when another German man, then working on the railways, found the tunnel's entrance.

'A few Germans carried on living in the area after the war and this one had been working on the railways when he came across the entrance to the tunnel,' Slowikowski explained to MailOnline.

'He saw two tracks leading into the tunnel. The tunnel was blocked up very shortly afterwards.'

But the railway worker didn't say anything because he was afraid of what might happen - and with good reason: he feared he would meet the same fate as a family murdered in cold blood, apparently to keep the existence of the tunnel secret.

Holding up an old black and white wartime photo showing a man and two young boys standing outside a house with a tiled roof, Mr Slowikowski said: 'This house used to overlook the track.

'From the top window you could see everything coming and going on the railway line. On the 5th of May 1945, the family living there were all shot dead and the house razed to the ground. It was three days before the Soviets took the town.

'Whoever killed them didn't want them talking about anything they had seen. There is nothing there now. Just an empty space where the house used to be. Nothing has been built there since.'

But the elderly German man eventually plucked up the courage to tell Schulz what he had seen on his deathbed - and this was the information now passed onto Mr Slowikowski.

It was enough to pique Mr Slowikowski's interest in the train, which local legend says is filled with Nazi gold, stolen from the Jews they sent to their deaths in their millions.

In the four decades since, Mr Slowikowski, who is widely recognised in Poland as being one of the leading experts on the missing train, has studied maps and data from the area.

Poring over a yellowing, dog-eared map from 1928, he outlined the route from Wroclaw to Walbrzych which clearly shows a siding going into the hillside.

The siding and the tunnel have now both gone.

After presenting his findings to the government, he said he was given official permission in 2003 to begin exploring the area.

But it seems there were still those who wanted to keep the existence of the train secret.

He said: 'As soon as we started, three men in civilian clothes and carrying guns came up to us and threatened us, telling us to stop. I didn't know who they were, but I had my suspicions.

'Shortly afterwards my dog was poisoned. Then my front door was smashed in and then my phones began to be tapped. These were classic tactics of the secret police when they wanted to intimidate people.’

He added: 'It continues today. My phone is still monitored and I was warned recently by some strangers to stay away. I got a phone call telling me to keep my nose out.'

The warnings echo that of another researcher MailOnline spoke to.

Asking not to be named for fear of reprisals, the treasure hunter said: 'I received a phone call from a mysterious man who warned me to stay away from the story and to not get involved.

'A lot of dangerous people are interested in finding this train, this could have been a warning from one of them. This man who called me knows that I know something.’

Now, Mr Slowikowski’s son Marek, 49, says his family is living in fear after men tried breaking into the family home.

And he says the two men who have made the claim to finding the missing train used his father’s maps and documents to locate it.

He said that the two men, a German and a Pole, came to the house after making the claim to apologise for using his father’s information.

Now, son Marek says he has put the top secret documents into a bank amid fears that others keen to get their hands on the loot are trying to steal them.

In a statement released to the press, Marek Slowikowski said: “I Marek Slowikowski, the son of Tadeusz (discoverer of the gold train), declare that for of the safety of my family (my father is very old and in poor physical condition) I have been forced to deposit the original documents in the form of maps and plans in the bank following several attempts by someone to break into my apartment (my father's family apartment).”

A police spokesman said: “We have assured the Slowikowski family that we will provide them with full protection if they need it.”

Earlier in the day, Poland’s Defence Minister Tomasz Siemoniak said a military reconnaissance team would be sent in the next few days to carry out reconnaissance of the area where the train is thought to be.

On Monday, the location was sealed off and is now being patrolled by police, forest guards and railway security guards."

1333,"The state fined 30 oil companies on Thursday for failing to meet a deadline to report information about the source, volume and disposal of water used in oil and gas production.

Under a 2014 law, California's 433 oil producers were required to report the data to the California Department of Conservation, but only half filed completed reports in time. Another quarter of the companies complied but turned in incomplete reports.

The 30 companies, which the state said made no apparent attempt to file reports, were given the maximum civil fine of $4,500. Operators who fail to meet subsequent reporting deadlines after being fined may be subject to larger civil penalties, said Steve Bohlen, the state oil and gas supervisor.

""We have made it clear that, given severe drought conditions in the state, knowledge of how water is used and treated is vital,"" Bohlen said.

The law, written by Sen. Fran Pavley (D-Agoura Hills), requires operators to submit quarterly reports on a well-by-well basis that include as much as 250 pieces of data.

The first deadline was April 30, but the Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources notified the Legislature that because of the complexities of the reporting, it was giving operators a grace period until June 1.

DOGGR, too, missed the reporting deadline. The agency said the law passed last year had vastly increased the data the state is required to collect from oil companies. Regulators are now required to track 200 billion data elements, far exceeding DOGGR's antiquated data management capacity, officials said.

The first set of data was released in mid-August.

Pavley has chided the agency, saying that it had ample notice of the requirements and that agency staff never raised concerns about meeting the reporting target.

""The department's failure to comply with the law is another example of poor management and lax regulation of the oil and gas industry that has implications for California's economy and the public health,"" Pavley said. ""The public — during a serious drought — needs to know where this water comes from and where it's going.""

California's oil fields produce far more water than oil. Last year the state produced more than 205 million barrels of oil with 3.3 billion barrels of water, according to the Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources."

1620,"Over 2 million consumers enrolled in the federal insurance exchange may be paying more out of pocket for doctors' visits and hospital stays than they should be. The reason? They’re not receiving the Affordable Care Act’s cost-sharing reductions (CSRs), even though they’re eligible.

According to a recent study by Avalere Health, only 5.9 million of the 8.1 million eligible people enrolled in federal exchanges are receiving those CSRs. That leaves 2.2 million consumers who aren't receiving them because they're enrolled in plans that don't qualify. To access CSRs, exchange consumers must enroll in a “silver” level plan, which covers an average of 70 percent of medical claims. They also need to have incomes between 100 percent and 250 percent of the federal poverty level ($11,770-$29,425).

I talked with Avalere’s Elizabeth Carpenter, who wrote the study. She told me the reason the cost-sharing subsides aren’t being utilized is because many consumers are focused only on their premiums, rather than their out-of-pocket costs-- so they may be paying more for doctor and hospital visits than they need to. For example, some CSR-eligible consumers are likely enrolling in bronze plans, rather than the required silver plans, because of the lower premiums.

The administration has also been publicizing the premium tax credits, without as much of a focus on cost-sharing. Carpenter admitted cost-sharing isn’t such an easy concept for the average consumer to grasp. “It’s really easy to demonstrate how a tax credit will lower your premium, but it's harder to visualize how cost-sharing reductions lower out-of-pocket costs,” she said. “It's harder still to know how your out-of-pocket costs will change from year to year.”

But the administration should make more of an effort to change that, Carpenter said. The navigators who sign people up for insurance can be better educated, for one. And consumers need tools that highlight the trade-off between monthly premiums and out-of-pocket costs and demonstrate the benefits of cost-sharing reductions—such as a calculator tool integrated into HealthCare.gov where consumers can estimate how much they'll pay in deductibles."

Dargey and the “Path America” companies raised $125 million or more for a commercial building (called Potala Tower) in downtown Seattle and a commercial and residential complex, complete with a farmer’s market, in Everett, Wash.

But the SEC claims not all of the money made it to the real estate projects. Dargey allegedly spent $14 million for unrelated real estate projects and $3 million for “personal use” such as for him buying a $2.5 million house, as well as “cash withdrawals at casinos,” the SEC said. The total misappropriated amount was $17.6 million, the SEC claims.

Also, Dargey withdrew investor funds of more than $200,000 while at 14 different casinos in Washington, Nevada, California and British Columbia, Canada, the SEC adds.

The two official real estate projects were approved to be funded by the EB-5 visa program.

2177,"In a sign of how highly Kinex values its drug candidates, the company in October filed a $2.9 billion lawsuit accusing a former top executive of breaching a confidentiality agreement and passing along trade secrets to two rival drug makers.

The company in May reached a confidential settlement with Lyn Dyster, its co-founder and one-time senior vice president of operations. But Kinex continues to pursue its litigation against pharmaceutical companies Fulgent Therapeutics and ANP Technologies

According to papers filed in State Supreme Court, the case traces back to November 2012, when Dyster and other Kinex officials met with Fulgent President Ming Hsieh, a billionaire entrepreneur and philanthropist, in an effort to get him to invest in Kinex.

Hsieh turned them down, but Dyster later entered into a consulting agreement with Fulgent. Kinex said Dyster didn’t tell anyone she was consulting for Fulgent and said the agreement with Fulgent violated the terms of her contract with the Buffalo company.

Kinex said Dyster encouraged a Kinex colleague to share confidential information with representatives of Fulgent and ANP and gave employees of the two companies access to Kinex computer systems and research.

Kinex is one of a number of companies working to develop a cheaper, more effective way to deliver Paclitaxel, the popular cancer drug that is administered intravenously. Kinex argues that its oral delivery method could grab the company a major share of the market, and efforts by Fulgent or ANP to learn proprietary information about the method could cause serious harm to Kinex.

In her responses to the suit, Dyster said Kinex officials were well aware of her dealings with Fulgent and ANP and she denied divulging confidential information to the companies. Dyster’s attorney, Robert J. Fluskey Jr. of Hodgson Russ, did not respond to messages seeking comment.

“We’ve settled our litigation with Lyn Dyster on mutually acceptable terms, and our litigation with the two companies continues,” said Flint D. Besecker, Kinex’s chief operating officer. “I won’t discuss the specifics. I think the complaint lays out our case in a lot of detail, so I’ll just let that speak for itself.”

California-based Fulgent and Delaware-based ANP said in their own court filings the information Kinex seeks to protect is publicly available, they didn’t gain any improper benefit from Dyster’s consulting work and any harm to Kinex’s business interests is speculative at best."
1669,"Gold prices in India swung to a discount to the global benchmark this week for the first time since mid July as a weak monsoon dampened demand in the world’s second-biggest consumer.

Dealers offered discounts of 50 cents to $4 an ounce, compared to premiums of 70 cents to $1.50 last week. In July, prices fell to a discount of $15 due to tepid demand.

Monsoon rains are likely to be below the prior forecast of 88 per cent of the long-term average, which could make it the driest year since 2009 and worsen rural distress by cutting farm output.

Two-thirds of gold demand in India comes from rural areas where jewellery is a traditional store of wealth.

“There are concerns over demand from rural areas due to poor rainfall,” said Kumar Jain, vice-president of the Mumbai Jewellers Association.

“Even in urban areas demand is modest. Many customers are waiting for prices to come down to July levels,” Jain said.

Gold prices in India hit their lowest level in four years in late July, following a sharp drop in global prices , but they have rebounded nearly 8 per cent as of Friday.

“Anticipating higher demand at lower levels, everyone imported aggressively last month. But demand wasn’t that strong,” said a Mumbai-based bank dealer. “Now they are struggling to clear stocks.”

In other parts of Asia, demand remained tepid with markets in No. 1 consumer China closed on Thursday and Friday for public holidays.

In Hong Kong, premiums were largely unchanged between 90 cents and $1.30 an ounce.

In Tokyo, prices have been at a discount of about 50 cents for last three weeks, dealers said.

“In our retail store, we are not seeing significant buying interest. Some customers are selling gold back to us,” said a Japanese trader.

Other data also showed weakness in the physical markets. Gold sales at the Perth Mint dipped in August from a nine-month high in the previous month as prices recovered from a 5-1/2-year low hit in July."
1056,"HENDERSON COUNTY, N.C. -- One of Western North Carolina's leading agents in real estate is going on-the-record about the proposed Duke power lines. 



Neal Hanks of real estate firm Beverly Hanks says the proposed lines will have a major negative impact on property values near or facing the proposed route. 



""There's no question 140-foot towers and transmission lines are going to have a negative impact on the viewshed and property values,"" Hanks said. ""We've had a number of different transactions during the last month or so that have fallen apart where buyers refused to go forward with a transaction because they've looked at a proposed route and elected not to purchase because of proposed route.""



Asheville attorney Jackson Bebber is an expert on eminent domain. He said an Asheville real estate firm had him draft an addendum for their standard real estate contract to point out the possibility that Duke could assert their right for eminent domain once the utility giant chooses a route for the 40-mile power line.



""Duke does have a right to take your property, if it's for a public purpose,"" Bebber said. ""But they do have to give you just compensation and that is your Fifth Amendment right.""



In other words, Duke has to pay property owners fair market value, but Bebber said he has seen cases where low-ball offers come in during such a process. 



He said property owners have every right to fight an offer if they feel it's too low. Duke, in such a case, he said, would have to pay forward a deposit of the market value price, and the legal proceedings would move forward from there. 



Bebber said attorneys will often take such cases on a contingency bases. He went on to explain how the process would work after Duke announces their route.



""They will identify all the property owners in that route, all the properties. And notify all the property owners,"" Bebber said.

To illustrate differences among state economies, the folks at HowMuch.net created a chart that shows the relative economic value of each US state.

The states are also color-coded based on which region of the country they're in.

The three regions that contribute the most to the economy are the Far West (18.6%), Southeast (21.3%), and Mideast (18.2%). California (13.3%), Texas (9.5%), and New York (8.1%) have the largest economies in the country.

Maine, Rhode Island, North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, and Alaska all represent about 0.3% of the US economy each, and, at 0.2%, Vermont has the smallest economy of all 50 states."
1285,"A recent article by Somen Mondel on LinkedIn (What type of sales person are you?) outlined a 6 month old study which analysed Ideal Candidate’s 20,000 plus profiles, which included 1000 of top performing salespeople, and 1000 of actual interviews. As a result of this analysis, the group was able to divide salespeople into seven distinct categories.

Sales and marketing firm Paragon Acquisitions has looked into these seven categories and has come up with its own evaluation of the personality types that suit the firm’s selling strategies.

Paragon Acquisitions believes that it is important for a sales person to understand which type of sales personality they are because when a person knows more about their strengths, they can use them to help sculpt a sales career. A seasoned salesperson or someone looking to start a career in sales can use this knowledge to help close more deals or to help them find a sales position that suits their selling style.

Paragon Acquisitions is a direct marketing firm, so the type of sales people that suits the firm’s campaigns would be ‘the relationship builder’. This is because direct marketing relies heavily on the ability to form personalised relationships with customers, in-order to be able to understand individual needs and sell a product or service tailor made to them. This relationship building will then result in long lasting business relationships between the client and the customer which provides overall business success for the client and a happy customer with excellent brand loyalty.

Paragon Acquisitions believes that the other personality types are just as important and welcome sales people who are competitive, team players, problems solvers and achievers. But the firm also believes that it can teach these qualities through its excellent training program.

Paragon Acquisitions specialises in outsourced sales and marketing to increase its clients' market share. Since the firm’s establishment, it has continued to grow and flourish within the outsourced sales and marketing industry. The firm is on a continued journey of growth, building assets including branding, finance, national reach, sales and marketing teams and management.

96,"Your midweek news roundup of SEC football is back and more caffeinated than ever before.

Those jitters you're feeling can only mean one thing: RCR's weekly check-in with our SEC foes has returned. Those jitters that Les Miles is feeling, however, may or may not be linked to a crippling coffee addiction, which he says caused a headache blinding enough to warrant a hospital trip on Monday. Word?

This story is so damn Les Miles. The Rad Hatter quoted Mark Twain -- ""Rumors of my demise have been greatly exaggerated"" -- while telling WBRZ that he temporarily ""OD'd on coffee."" Les Miles is an actual crazy person, true, but his physical constitution is thankfully alright. Maybe try half decaf next time, Coach.

Speaking of actual crazy people, Nick Saban has yet to name a starting quarterback for the season, though with five potential slingers in the bullpen, he's not hurting for options. No matter, though, since first-year QBs can prove to be an asset, and in any case Bama's defense looks as nasty as ever.

With the embers of Will Muschamp's tire fire still smoldering in Gainesville, it's amazing that Florida will attempt to play football this season. But try they will, and with dueling quarterbacks to boot. The untested Will Grier and the well-tested-and-pretty-much-just-OK Treon Harris will vie for generalship duties against New Mexico State as Jim McElwain commences work in the Swamp.

Speaking of tire fires, the No. 25 Tennessee Volunteers might just turn some heads this season. Rocky Top returns a full 21 starters from 2014, including the bulk of their offensive and defensive lines. For a team that has a wideout literally named ""Pig Howard"" and a preseason ranking less believable than a Greg Hardy rap album, expectations in Knoxville are ripe to come crashing down after an inexplicable bed-wetting in Gainesville later this month.

The other Bulldogs are also playing football this season, and like so many seasons before they have expectations, man. Team Speed Kills' David Wunderlich has lit a fire redder than 2003's hype, and with a healthy Nick Chubb the East Dawgs could do some real violence in 2015. Wunderlich also likes the Ole Miss Rebels of Oxford, Miss. to win the SEC West and tosses in this strikingly astute observation besides:

The bye week coming late will hurt, as it doesn't land until November 14. [The Rebels] will probably start to run low on gas and drop the game against Arkansas's brutal offense on their tenth consecutive week of playing. Other than that and the early road game against Bama, the schedule works out fairly well. Getting Vandy and rebuilding Florida from the East is a boost, and Ole Miss is a huge beneficiary of Bruce Feldman's Body Blow Theory. Auburn plays the Rebels a week after Arkansas, A&M plays them the week after Bama, and both LSU and Mississippi State play them after getting the Tide and Hogs in consecutive weeks. The stars aren't aligning for an undefeated run, but for a West title? Maybe so.

It just might work, dammit.

If you're passing through Starkville this week, do State a solid and drop off Brandon Larrabee's thought experiment in Dan Mullen's mailbox. Everyone, it seems, is of one or the other opinion on MSU this year: either they've lost too many starters to do too much damage, or they're returning just the right personnel to dark-horse themselves off to Atlanta. Whatever happens, the Dak Attack could bring home some hardware of his own this year.

Pour one out -- or don't -- for Kevin Sumlin and the Aggies who get a deceptively tough matchup against Arizona State to open the season in Houston. Our friends at Good Bull Hunting have also done the Lord's work by writing up a fines list for bad behavior at A&M home games this year, and overalls are officially banned from Kyle Field. Good work, fellas.

Gary Pinkel talked to SB Nation's Bill Connelly over the summer and gave the quote of the year: ""Everybody's favorite player's the backup QB, but then he throws three INTs."" That's Spurrier-level frankness from a man who's been quietly making his way through the SEC East for a few years now, and it speaks to his game intelligence that he was recently on the SEC Network's coaches sit-down alongside such conference luminaries as Saban, Miles, and Hugh Freeze.

College and Magnolia are feeling pretty good about themselves for topping the GRAMMAR POWER RANKINGS released this week, which isn't much of a surprise, what with all that free time at home to write internet comments while Georgia Tech graduates go to all those jobs you were turned down for. Anyway, Gus Malzahn and his Muschamp-drawn cart head over to Atlanta for a whimsy little match against Louisville on Saturday. Afterward, both squads will take in the sights and sounds of DragonCon with all the other weirdos.

Bret Bielema's high-octane run-game has a Heisman hopeful in Alex Collins. With Jonathan Williams out for the season, Collins is picking up the balance of carries in the Fayetteville backfield.

Who the hell knows what's gonna happen in Lexington on Saturday, let alone this season. They might knick a South Carolina or a Georgia on a down week, but really, who the hell knows.

Vandy will host Georgia on CBS for their September 12 barn-burner. If Nick Chubb gets injured this season, this is the game when that happens.

You might think that football begins on Saturday, but you'd be dead wrong. Steve Spurrier's Gamecocks start the weekend on Thursday against UNC in Charlotte, and the Head Ball Coach sees question marks at every position this year. Whatever happens, this game will feature approximately 14 bonkers turnovers and still end 17-10. Now that's some must-watch television, or, better still, if you find yourself near Loop-485, why don't you just stop by in person:

Absolutely flooring that a Thursday-nighter during the first week of classes isn't drawing more drunken attention. Amazing.

Three more days, everyone. Hang in there."

2018,"LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Rising mistrust of international charities and a public push for greater transparency on spending in corruption-prone crisis zones are compelling some non-government organizations (NGOs) to hire a new recruit - the criminal investigator.

In a bid to prevent as well as report fraudulent activity, Plan International, Oxfam GB, Americares and International Medical Corps are among those to have appointed trained counter-fraud directors at their head offices.

Others, such as Medicins Sans Frontieres, Handicap International and Action Against Hunger use auditors and finance officers to handle cases of fraud.

The growing trend to hire criminal investigators comes after the NGO sector has doubled in size in the past decade with a Thomson Reuters Foundation survey finding 50 of the world's biggest humanitarian NGOs spent $18 billion in 2013-14.

This rapid growth has fueled concerns over a lack of accountability with the annual Edelman Trust Barometer finding NGOs were the most trusted of four institutions but trust slipped in the past year with a perception they had become too money focused.

One forensic expert said the lack of experienced investigators can be a barrier to financial probity as NGOs faced a unique set of issues such as ghost employees, fictitious invoices, kickback arrangements and ""double-dipping"" to get funds from more than one donor for a project.

""External auditors, unlike [counter-fraud] officers, are not necessarily looking for evidence of fictitious receipts or inappropriate spending in the field,"" said Matthias Kiener, Zurich-based forensic officer with the consultancy, KPMG.

""Sometimes the due diligence is not done. That might be because many charities are founded on the principle of trust. An NGO might be reluctant to ask tough questions of some of those it employs,"" said Kiener, whose clients include large humanitarian organizations.

In July a Thomson Reuters Foundation survey revealed a third of humanitarian NGOs with budgets greater than $150 million were not prepared to reveal their annual fraud figures.

Others, such as BRAC, Direct Relief, Americares, Oxfam US and Sightsavers all said they had not experienced any fraud greater than $10,000 in the last five years.

But critics question the rationale in not reporting fraud data, speculating that it could be an indication of under detection and less effective management.

Oliver May, Oxfam GB's head of counter-fraud and a former UK organized crime investigator, said NGOs were reluctant to share fraud data, partly for fear of jeopardizing donations, but an increase in NGO fraud reporting would be a welcome change.

Oxfam GB said it lost 0.16 percent of its income to fraud and corruption in 2014-15, although some was recovered.

""Really fraud is a problem for all organizations. It is an environmental risk for us and it should be less reassuring when an NGO is not reporting fraud than when it is,"" May told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

""If there is no detection it is harder to know what the problem looks like ... What we really want to see is the publication of annual fraud data across the whole NGO sector - that would really be an important step.""

It is important for charities to accept that corruption permeates every corner of the world, and every walk of life, including humanitarian organizations, said Gary Mitchell, Plan International's director of global assurance.

The charity, employing nearly 10,000 staff globally, has allocated $300,000 (200,000 pounds) annually to staffing anti-corruption efforts.

""In [parts of] Africa, for example, we know extended families are a way of life and we would expect you to hire your uncle's third cousin because that is the way it is,"" said Mitchell.

""That's a reality we have to face in combating fraud. Societies differ in what they perceive to be corrupt.""

Plan's attitude to corruption - like that of Oxfam GB's - contrasts with that of U.S.-based Direct Relief, which has not reported any incidence of fraud over $10,000.

The charity sends medical relief and equipment to partners in disaster zones who then use them in their programs.

""I'm not aware of any circumstance where we haven't put boots on the ground [to] oversee the [aid] distributions. It would be hard for anyone to get hold of the shipments and misappropriate them,"" said Ernie Getto, chair of Direct Relief's audit committee since 2014.

""We have been audited externally – and everything we have been audited about has come out with a good result. I am not saying we are perfect but I think we are as close to it as an organization can get,"" said Getto.

Getto believes the dearth of fraud reports is partly due to the NGO's size. Despite having spent over $550 million in the period 2013-2014 he said the charity employs just 65 people at its head office and warehouse in Santa Barbara, California.

""Everybody is sitting there in that building ... there is not a lot of cash flowing through the organization,"" said Getto, adding that he is considering proposing a whistle-blowing fraud hotline in the interests of best practice."
1380,"Oil expert John Kilduff, who's been correctly calling crude's plunge, said Tuesday the recent surge in prices won't continue.

Crude dropped more than 4 percent in early trading Tuesday, putting a dent in the more than 27 percent rally in the three previous sessions. Prices staged a major turnaround Monday, settling in New York up nearly 9 percent.



""This three-day rally rivals what we saw in 1990 with the Gulf War in terms of the price spike up,"" he said in a CNBC ""Squawk Box"" interview. ""A lot of people were caught short and you saw massive buying.""

""There's not a lot of support for this recent run-up,"" he said.

Kilduff founding partner of Again Capital, an alternative investment manager specializing in energy and metals, recently predicted further declines in U.S. crude to at least the low $30-per-barrel area. In a mid-August CNBC commentary, he wrote, ""a trip down to the mid-$20s cannot be ruled out."" U.S. oil prices made a recent bottom of $38 last month.

Kilduff was not all gloom and doom on Tuesday. He said he sees the ""seeds of recovery"" starting to emerge.

The economic slowdown in China and the excess in worldwide production continued to weigh on the market.

But he said he was encouraged somewhat by an OPEC statement that the cartel was willing to talk to other producers to achieve reasonable oil prices, as well as the downward revision of U.S. output data by the U.S. Energy Information Administration."

Benchmark West Texas Intermediate touched a 6 ½-year low of $37.75 last week before rallying higher as short sellers moved to cover positions after an initial bounce.



The October contract for U.S. crude settled 8.8 percent higher at $49.20 on Monday, fueled by government data that showed U.S. crude production declined in June and signs that OPEC may be willing to work with other producers to stabilize oil prices.

""Does this rally have legs?"" Grisanti asked. ""I'm not so sure about that because we still have a huge oversupply in crude oil around the world.""

A sustained climb that brings U.S. crude back to $50 to $55 per barrel will spur U.S. shale oil drillers to bring new or idled production online, exasperating oversupply, Grisanti said. Unlike deep-water drilling, it take just a few weeks and a few million dollars to start up U.S. shale production, he said."
741,"NEW YORK – Too many politicians and economists blame austerity – urged by Greece’s creditors – for the collapse of the Greek economy. But the data show neither marked austerity by historical standards nor government cutbacks severe enough to explain the huge job losses. What the data do show are economic ills rooted in the values and beliefs of Greek society.

Greece’s public sector is rife with clientelism (to gain votes) and cronyism (to gain favors) – far more so than in other parts of Europe. Maximum pensions for public employees relative to wages are nearly twice as high as in Spain; the government favors business elites with tax-free status; and some state employees draw their salaries without actually turning up for work.

There are serious ills in the private sector, too – notably, the pervasive influence of vested interests and the country’s business and political elites. Profits as a share of business income in Greece are a whopping 46%, according to the latest available data. Italy came in second at 42%, with France third, at 41%. (Germany’s share is 39%; the United States’, 35%; and the United Kingdom’s, 32%.) Insiders receive subsidies and contracts, and outsiders find it hard to break in. Astoundingly, young Greek entrepreneurs reportedly fear to incorporate their firms in Greece, lest others use false documents to take away their companies. According to the World Bank, Greece is one of the hardest places in Europe to start a business. The result is that competition for market share is weak and there are few firms with new ideas.

This stunted system springs from Greece’s corporatist values, which emphasize social protection, solidarity instead of competition, and discomfort with uncontrolled change. These values may well be beneficial for family life; but, even with the best of intentions, they are a recipe for a static economy and stultified careers.

Indeed, Greece’s labor productivity (GDP per worker) is only 72% of the level in the UK and Italy, and a mere 57.7% of that in Germany. And surveys indicate that mean life satisfaction in Greece is far below that found in the wealthiest EU countries (the EU15). Contrary to claims by the Greek government, corporatism impoverishes the less advantaged. EU data on poverty rates in 2010 put Greece at 21.4% – far higher than the mean EU15 rate of 16.7%.

To be sure, Greece saw productivity gains after World War II – but mostly from increases in education and capital per worker, which can go only so far. Two important sources of broad prosperity are blocked by Greece’s system. One is an abundance of entrepreneurs engaged in detecting and exploiting new economic opportunities. Without them, Greece does a poor job of adjusting to changing circumstances (an imperative emphasized by Friedrich Hayek). Greece’s much-lauded shipowners, for example, were too slow to adapt to containerization, and thus lost their market share.

The other source of broad prosperity is an abundance of business people engaged in conceiving and creating new products and processes – often termed “indigenous innovation.” Here, Greece lacks the necessary dynamism: venture capital investment flows are smaller, relative to GDP, in Greece than in any other EU country. So Greece’s economy has scant ability to create sustained productivity growth and high human satisfaction.

Some economists believe that these structural considerations have nothing to do with Greece’s current crisis. In fact, a structuralist perspective illuminates what went wrong – and why.

For several years, Greece drew on the EU’s aptly named “structural funds” and on loans from German and French banks to finance a wide array of highly labor-intensive projects. Employment and incomes soared, and savings piled up. When that capital inflow stopped, asset prices in Greece fell, and so did demand for labor in the capital-goods sector. Moreover, with household wealth having far outstripped wage rates, the supply of labor diminished. Thus, Greece went from boom to outright slump.

The structuralist perspective also explains why recovery has been slow. With competition weak, entrepreneurs did not rush to hire the unemployed. When recovery began, political unrest last fall nipped confidence in the bud.

The truth is that Greece needs more than just debt restructuring or even debt relief. If young Greeks are to have a future in their own country, they and their elders need to develop the attitudes and institutions that constitute an inclusive modern economy – which means shedding their corporatist values.

Europe, for its part, must think beyond the necessary reforms of Greece’s pension system, tax regime, and collective-bargaining arrangements. While Greece has reached the heights of corporatism, Italy and France are not far behind – and not far behind them is Germany. All of Europe, not just Greece, must rethink its economic philosophy."
532,"HELSINKI Finland's gross domestic product (GDP) achieved surprised with growth in the second quarter, revised data from the statistics office showed on Friday.

GDP increased 0.2 percent quarter-on-quarter, compared to the office's initial estimate of a 0.4 percent decline.

First-quarter GDP was revised to 0.0 percent from a previous estimate of a 0.1 percent fall.

The revisions are not likely to change the commonly shared view that the economy is set to contract somewhat for the year, one economist said.

""I think this GDP change is mainly due to a temporary drop in imports, which possibly had to with a long outage at Neste's oil refinery. Private consumption and exports still looked weak,"" Nordea economist Pasi Sorjonen said.

The Helsingin Sanomat daily newspaper on Friday reported that the government is planning to cut its GDP forecasts, following recent cuts by private banks.

The finance ministry declined to comment the newspaper report but said it now had to review everything in the light of the new data. Its next forecast is due at the end of September.

""We have to do the whole process all over again. Such a big volatility in official data raises questions,"" said Mika Kuismanen, a senior ministry official.

Finland's economy has contracted for three consecutive years because of weak demand in European and Russian markets and problems affecting its main export industries, including technology."
1486,"Eni's discovery of potentially the world's largest natural-gas field off the Egyptian coast will be a gamechanger for Egypt and the Mediterranean in terms of energy stability, the CEO of the Italian energy giant told CNBC on Monday.

On Sunday, Eni said in a press release that it had discovered a ""supergiant"" gas field that could hold ""a potential of 30 trillion cubic feet of lean gas in place."" It said the discovery well was located off Egypt's Mediterranean coastline at a depth of 1,450 metres with the prospective Zohr field covering an area of about 100 square kilometres (60 square miles).

Eni said that the discovery could satisfy Egypt's natural gas demand for ""decades"".

1743,"Commodities tend to run in long cycles. The huge run-up in their prices, which peaked in 2011, has now degenerated into a rout. People who think that this situation will stabilize and turn around anytime soon are kidding themselves.

China's pell-mell growth was the stimulus for the so-called commodity super-cycle , which began around 2002. But the huge nation's expansion couldn't go on forever at a double-digit clip. China's deceleration to a 7% rate, while pretty good by Western standards (the U.S. grows at a 2% pace), is enough to squelch the commodity boom, and keep it squelched for a good long while. Not to mention, plunge stocks into correction territory , as we've seen lately.

When you go on an eating binge, especially with food that's rich in calories, the body finds a way of correcting your overindulgence. In the same spirit, the world continues to grapple with the aftermath of a 10-year feast of infrastructure spending in emerging markets, which their commodity exports underwrote.

Consequently, commodity prices in these markets hit an 11-year low recently.

Countries like Canada and Brazil are hurt because of their exposure to oil, along with other self-inflicted wounds (like Brazil's political turmoil). The Dow Jones Commodity Index is down more than 15% this year.

Brazil, which produces a range of commodities from iron ore to oil seed, has fallen far. Moody's Investors Service downgraded its government debt recently to one grade above junk status, and the real, its currency, just hit a 12-year low. Look at the fate of one of its prime exports, sugar , which has dropped 70% from its high in February 2011. Brazilian sugar growers ramped up output far beyond a sustainable level.

In the capital markets, the implications from the commodity crash continue to reverberate. Oil is the biggest problem. Samson Resources, an oil and gas producer that private equity powerhouse KKR backs, plans to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection - it's the victim of plummeting energy prices. You have to believe other areas of the oil complex are starting to feel some serious pain as well.

Oddly, oil output hasn't dwindled as the result of the price plunge. Due to the global glut, the price is off one-third since June, touching $40 per barrel in mid-August. A brief surged petered out Tuesday.

Oil production remains at lofty levels because of the advances in technology.  Extraction costs continue to get dramatically cheaper, although much depends on how attractive the geology of the field is.

Still, with the bulk of output in the first few years of drilling, especially in shale-related territories, the dramatic reduction of rig counts should start to drag down production levels, probably beginning in 2016. Operating rigs are down by more than half from 12 months prior.

I continue to believe consolidation is going to happen in the oil patch, especially with cheap capital available.  It is not a matter of if, but when, and with whom.

But that would serve the oil industry only as a bulwark again a long, bad trend. The same goes for other commodities.

1090,"LAHORE: Pakistan’s real estate market has started showing a positive trend in the second half of 2015, making up for the rather dull second quarter.

The country’s property market seems to have rediscovered its zeal on Eid that brings many overseas Pakistanis back home for holidays.

According to a report released by zameen.com; a property portal, Lahore and Islamabad have successfully recovered from the short-lived slump witnessed in their property market during the month of Ramazan.

With investments coming in from a vast pool of overseas Pakistanis visiting home for Eid, Lahore in particular, the market has made a sound comeback. “Bahria Town seems to be a favourite locality for them, as reflected in the striking growth of its property rates,” said the report.

THe property market experienced a decline due to a number of factors during Ramazan and the month preceding it.

Doubts involving the route of Lahore Ring Road’s southern loop along with a less-than-sufficient drive in the market resulted in small investments spread randomly over the time preceding Eid.

Post-Eid, however, prices took a positive turn as reflected in the growing popularity of LDA Avenue-1 and Bahria Town.

A growth of 5.778% in the average prices of 1-kanal plots for LDA Avenue-1 in the evident by the stark increase in prices. Bahria Town also showed a controlled rise of about 4.16%, while Lahore’s Cantt’s 1-kanal plots managed to exhibit steadiness with a negligible 0.46% rise in prices after having been continuously falling since January. DHA Lahore, however, exhibited a modest 1.44% increase. With an average price of Rs37.9 million for 1-kanal houses, DHA Lahore topped the charts in Lahore. It was followed closely by Lahore Cantt that offered the same sized property for Rs37.5 million.

DHA Lahore also offered the highest rental yield for July 2015, up 4.11%.

While Sector F-11 remained stable, investors focused on Sector E-11 and Bahria Town during July 2015.

The controversial situation in DHA Islamabad brought about by DHA Valley issues and Dadocha Dam brought the prices down to where they were at the beginning of the year.

A drop of 6.44% in 1-kanal plot prices in DHA Islamabad contrasted sharply with a 5.96% rise in price for the same-sized plots in Bahria Town. Sector F-11 was relatively stable with a 0.89% fall in prices, while Sector E-11 depicted a controlled rise in prices that went up 4.11% since the previous month.

Despite the marginal increase, Sector F-11 remained one of the most expensive places to buy a 1-kanal house in Islamabad with an average price of Rs68.5 million. Sector E-11 followed close with Rs63.5 million.However, Bahria Town managed to offer the highest rental yield with a 4.28% return.

The improved security situation of the city benefitted the property market immensely.

Apart from DHA City Karachi, figures improved sharply following the operation by the security forces, especially Gulshan-e-Iqbal and DHA Karachi.

For a 500-square-yards plot, the average price in DHA Karachi rose moderately by 4.65%, while in Gulshan-e-Iqbal, the average prices went up by 5.76%. Against this major boost, Bahria Town Karachi exhibited a controlled rise of 3.62%, whereas a 0.34% increase in average prices for same-sized plots in DHA City Karachi meant stability for this under-development project.

Though offering the highest rental yield of about 5.01%, Gulshan-e-Iqbal’s average price of Rs37.7 million for a 500-square-yards house fell second to DHA Karachi’s average prices for houses of the same size at Rs59.3 million.

789,"Athene Holding Ltd., the insurer tied to Apollo Global Management LLC, named ex-MetLife Inc. executive William Wheeler as president as it prepares to go public.

Wheeler, 54, spent 17 years at MetLife before leaving last month. He takes over at Athene on Sept. 28, the Bermuda-based insurer said Thursday in a statement. Athene, led by Chief Executive Officer Jim Belardi, has been flagging plans for an initial public offering for more than a year. Grant Kvalheim remains CEO of Athene USA.

“I look forward to working with the team to produce significant profitable growth, deliver strong financial results and help take the company public,” Wheeler said in the statement.

Apollo helped start Athene about six years ago to buy insurance companies’ unwanted annuities, which provides income to retirees. Annuities became unprofitable during the financial crisis because they are linked to stock and bond markets. Wheeler worked to scale back risks tied to the products at MetLife, the largest U.S. life insurer.

Wheeler said in April that he was stepping down as president of MetLife’s Americas division, its largest unit. He helped integrate American Life Insurance Co. after a $16 billion acquisition, and oversaw the acquisition of pension provider AFP Provida SA. He joined investment bank Evercore Partners Inc. as a board member this year.

Athene agreed to buy a business from Delta Lloyd NV this year and purchased a unit of Aviva Plc in 2013. AP Alternative Assets LP, a publicly traded investment vehicle managed by Apollo, is Athene’s largest shareholder.

Wheeler’s departure spurred doubts about who may lead the MetLife as CEO Steve Kandarian nears the company’s mandatory retirement age of 65, a rule that can be waived by the board. The announcement of Wheeler’s leave sent MetLife shares falling the most in the 21-company Standard & Poor’s 500 Insurance Index on April 14.

MetLife hasn’t yet named a successor for Wheeler. He’s set to receive more than $2 million from MetLife and the separation agreement barred him from joining rival Prudential Financial Inc., according to an August regulatory filing."
521,What if the China Panic Is All Wrong?
859,"IMPALA Platinum (Implats), the world’s second-largest platinum producer, will raise up to R4bn in a rights issue to fund two new-generation mines as it scales back output from its operations by 180,000oz of platinum over the next five years.

The company will conduct an accelerated book-building process in the equity issue that is fully underwritten by UBS and 49% of shareholders have given their written support for the transaction. Implats needs 75% support for the issue.

Implats will close its 8 shaft and the mechanised operations at its 12 shaft because they are not profitable at current metal prices. The closures will happen by the end of December this year and would account for 145,000oz of the 180,000oz reduction.

Implats forecast production from its own mines would total between 815‚000oz and 830‚000oz by 2020‚ down from an earlier forecast of 850‚000oz.

The Impala Lease Area‚ which is where Implats’ own mines are‚ would reduce output by a cumulative 180‚000oz over five years as it curtails capital expenditure and closes some areas‚ the company said.

Implats had R2.6bn in cash at the end of its financial year in June and unused debt facilities of R3bn, which has been expanded to R3.5bn.

""In the current price environment, the group’s priorities have been materially rebalanced to focus on profitability and cash preservation. It is nevertheless critical to safeguard the completion of key capital projects to secure the long-term value of the group,"" the company said.

The new-generation mines are the 16 and 20 shafts, which need R3.9bn to complete over the next three years and replace the older, low-cost shafts, which will be mined out in coming years. Implats has spent R13bn on the two new shafts so far.

Implats will cut costs by R1.57bn in the current 2016 financial year, through a host of measures, including rescheduling development expenditure and contracts in SA and Zimbabwe, as well as by trimming head office costs.

It has further slowed development work at its new 17 shaft, extending the delay on the project by an additional 18 months over the plan it unveiled in February this year. Implats will spend R520m on the mine over the next two years.

Output from Implats’ own mines fell 1.2% in its 2015 financial year to 567,500oz of platinum, including the reduced contribution from Zimbabwe where its Bimha mine was temporarily closed.

Implats’ full-year revenue was 12% higher at R32.5bn on the back of higher metal sales and a weaker rand offsetting a fall in the dollar price of platinum group metals (PGMs).

Gross profit, however, fell by half to R1.6bn and the company reported a net impairment of R3.7bn. It recorded an attributable loss of R3.66bn compared with an R8m profit before.

Implats reported a basic loss per share of 603c for the year, down from earnings of 1c the year before.

""Following the operating and capital cost cutting response, the group is expected to be ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) positive in the current PGM price environment and free cash flow positive across the Impala Lease Area and IRS (Impala Refining Services), before replacement and development expenditure."""
1780,"NEW YORK ( TheStreet) -- From oil to copper to corn, commodity prices have collapsed in the past year. Scott Colyer, CEO of Advisors Asset Management, said the negativity toward hard assets is exactly why investors should start legging into energy and mining stocks.

""Inflation is highly correlated to commodity prices, so at a time period when 27 central banks around the world are easing and trying to create inflation, I don't think I want to put myself in front of that move,"" said Colyer. ""I would try and be properly aligned and congruent with what they are trying to do.""

Colyer added that he starting to see insider buying at commodity-based companies as well, pointing to insider purchasing this week at Southern Copper (SCCO - Get Report) as an example. Shares of Southern Copper are down over 21% in the past 12 months.

""When insiders take their checkbook out and there is fear in the market, and they write checks to buy stock in the open market, I think that's compelling and I think you have to pay attention to that,"" said Colyer.

China has been the world's biggest buyer of commodities in the past decade, and the slowdown in its economy has clearly impacted the market for hard assets, and is currently shaking up its stock market as well. The dislocation in China's stock market is being felt here by U.S. investors, yet Colyer said domestic markets are overreacting.

""They are a young market and they are very small,"" said Colyer. ""These things happen when you have markets that are small.""

Colyer said the People's Bank of China is now trying to stimulate the country's economy, so he sees the current choppiness as a buying opportunity. And he said China will also regain its appetite for commodities as the country regains its economic momentum.

By contrast, Colyer said he sees downside in the U.S. Treasury bond market -- an asset class he'd advise investors to avoid.

""Chinese folks have $3 trillion in foreign reserves, and right now they are liquidating Treasuries so they can buy in their own markets,"" said Colyer."

435,"Bund yields were down 4.7 bp, the DAX was up more than 2% after the ECB showed it still has wiggle room on QE by extending the pool of eligible assets for its program - albeit not by starting to buy different assets, but by lifting the bond-buying cap. This may mostly benefit German 10 and 30 year Bunds, where the limit was about to be reached. That German 2-year yields are already below the deposit rate and, thus, not eligible for purchases under QE, helps the ECB to achieve its current QE target. Eurozone spreads had mostly narrowed, with the Portuguese 10-year down nearly 9 bp. Spanish bonds and stocks continue to underperform, however, amid concerns about the outcome of the general election there this year.

30,"What went wrong in Greece? Greece's economic reforms that led to it abandoning the drachma as its currency in favour of the euro in 2002 made it easier for the country to borrow money. Greece went on a debt-funded spending spree, including high-profile projects such as the 2004 Athens Olympics, which went well over budget. It was hit by the downturn, which meant it had to spend more on benefits and received less in taxes. There were also doubts about the accuracy of its economic statistics. Greece's economic problems meant lenders started charging higher interest rates to lend it money and widespread tax evasion also hit the government's coffers. There have been demonstrations against the government's austerity measures to deal with its 300bn euro (£267bn) debt, such as cuts to public sector pay. Now the government is having to access a 110bn euro (£95bn; $146.2bn) bail-out package from the European Union and International Monetary Fund. Greece's problems have made investors nervous, which has made it more expensive for other European countries such as Portugal to borrow money. Eurozone members and the IMF have agreed a 110bn-euro (£95bn; $146.2bn) three-year bail-out package to rescue Greece's embattled economy. In return for the loans, Greece will make major austerity cuts which Prime Minister George Papandreou said involved ""great sacrifices"". The EU will provide 80bn euros in funding and the rest will come from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The deal is designed to prevent Greece from defaulting on its massive debt. However, it must first be approved by some parliaments in the 15 other eurozone countries. Luxembourg's Prime Minister, Jean-Claude Juncker, said up to 30bn euros would be disbursed to Greece in the first year. The first loan tranche will be released before 19 May - the date of Greece's next debt repayment, he said. The leaders of the 16-nation Eurogroup will hold a summit in Brussels on Friday to ""draw initial conclusions from the Greek crisis"", he added. This was a day the European Union never imagined - that what could turn out to be the largest bail-out ever would be needed by a country using the euro. Rescuing Greece remains very unpopular, especially in Germany, but German Chancellor Angela Merkel said it was the only way to ensure the stability of the single currency. What persuaded eurozone countries and the IMF to lend Greece such a large sum was the fear that if Greece defaulted other countries like Portugal or even Spain could follow. Plenty of doubts remain, however. The Greek economy will shrink by 4% this year and today's cuts could deepen the recession. What the plan does do is to buy time and shelter Greece from the fierce winds of the markets. The IMF is expected to approve its portion of the loan this week, IMF managing director Dominique Strauss-Kahn said. In return for the financial support, the Greek government has unveiled a fresh round of sweeping efficiencies, including further tax rises and deeper cuts in pensions and public service pay. The Eurogroup is trying to speed up rescue efforts for Greece amid fears its debt crisis could undermine other debt-laden states that use the single currency. Anxiety about contagion has focused on Portugal, Spain and the Republic of Ireland. Germany has been the most reluctant to bail out Greece, but its Economy Minister Rainer Bruederle said there was a ""good chance"" of getting German parliamentary agreement by Friday. Yet he said Greece had to implement its new austerity programme ""quickly"" and ""to the letter"". The Greek economy is still deep in recession and on Sunday the government forecast that GDP would fall by 4% in 2010. The country's national debt - currently at about 115% of GDP - would rise to 149% by 2013 before falling, it added. It is not going to be easy on Greek citizens, despite the efforts that have been made and will continue to be made to protect the weakest in society 

 Have your say Mr Papandreou told a televised cabinet meeting that active and retired public sector workers would bear the brunt of the new wave of budget cuts. ""With our decision today our citizens will have to make great sacrifices,"" he said, describing public anger at the new wave of cutbacks as ""evident"". ""Our national red line is to avoid bankruptcy,"" Mr Papandreou said, adding that ""no-one could have imagined"" the size of the debt that the previous government, which left office last year, had left behind. The austerity plan aims to achieve fresh budget cuts of 30bn euros over three years - with the goal of cutting Greece's public deficit to less than 3% of GDP by 2014. It currently stands at 13.6%. Capping annual holiday bonuses and axing them for higher earners Banning increases in public sector salaries and pensions for at least three years Raising taxes on fuel, alcohol and tobacco by 10% Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou said Greece had been called on to make a ""basic choice between collapse or salvation"". ""It is not going to be easy on Greek citizens, despite the efforts that have been made and will continue to be made to protect the weakest in society."" New emergency legislation authorising the cuts and tax rises is now being drafted and is due to be put before parliament for approval by the end of the week. However unions have vowed to fight the round of austerity measures. The third nationwide general strike in as many months is scheduled for Wednesday. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Greece's austerity plans were ""very ambitious"" and would spur other troubled eurozone members to do all they could to avoid the same fate. ""These countries can see that the path taken by Greece with the IMF is not an easy one. As a result they will do all they can to avoid this themselves,"" Mrs Merkel told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper.

729,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- North Main Street has seen little if any construction since the recession, but that's starting to change.

A senior apartment complex is going up at 42nd and Main giving encouragement to a community eagerly wanting to see construction return.

Numbers just released by the Northeast Builders Association show August was particularly strong, posting 592 permit applications in four Northeast Florida counties.

The August applications were the second highest tally of the year. St. Johns County continues to be the leader in housing permits with 354 made just last month.

On Main Street, Caroline Oaks there's a flurry of activity with 80-plus affordable housing units going in at the complex. The project is expected to be finished with people moving in around Christmastime.

""It is nice to have something built on Main Street,"" said Micheline Maxis, who has an auto repair shop across the street from the new complex.

""Hopefully Main Street will come up and that will bring business for everybody,"" said Maxis, who hopes similar types of development follow.

Main Street was hard hit by the recession with some buildings torn down and others still vacant.

""Change is good,"" said Brenda Dickerson as she walked by the apartments that will also house a community center and a dog park area for residents."
838,"Agrees Deven Choksey, Managing Director, K R Choksey: ""There are a number of issues in which there are pre-IPO investors who want to milk the issue. Avoid them.""

 

 Choksey believes that IPOs are an interesting option for the retail investor and do make investment sense. But pricing has to be taken into consideration.

 

 ""There is no universal answer to whether one should invest in IPOs or not. There are a lot of issues which are fully priced and don't leave much room for appreciation. So once they are listed, they fall sharply. There has to be a pick and choose approach.""

 

 Many retail investors approach the IPO market to make listing gains. That is, when stocks listed on the exchanges, many of them rise sharply, allowing investors to make a neat profit on the very first day or week.

 

 But the reverse may also happen and the stock might tank trapping the investor looking to make a quick buck. Once you are convinced that the company is good and has potential to do well, invest in it for the medium or long term."
2123,"Correction: MannKind converted $8 million of debt into 1.9 million shares of company stock. A typing error in the original version of the story said the conversion was 9 million shares. The story has been corrected.

VALENCIA, Calif. (TheStreet) -- MannKind (MNKD) failed to settle a $100 million convertible loan before an Aug. 15 deadline. The embattled diabetes-drug company is trying a second time to clear the debt, but on even less favorable terms, which will bleed off a larger chunk of cash.

The slow commercial launch of Afrezza, MannKind's inhaled mealtime insulin, continues to be the root cause of the company's balance-sheet woes. Afrezza prescriptions are stuck in neutral and net sales -- $2.2 million in the just-reported second quarter -- are well below expectations.

Absent any concrete evidence that Afrezza can become a profitable diabetes product, a majority of MannKind's current debt holders refused to exchange their paper for company stock by the August 15 deadline. That lack of confidence in MannKind's future is exacerbating the already-steep slide in the company's market value.

At Wednesday's $3.99 close, MannKind shares are down 24% this year and more than 60% since Afrezza's approval in June 2014.

MannKind's most pressing debt problem centers on a $57 million portion of the $100 million loan, which the company sought to convert into equity via a pricing scheme similar to a death-spiral convert. Over the course of 10 trading days earlier this month, MannKind was only able to convert $8 million of the debt into 1.9 million shares of newly issued company stock, according to its most recent quarterly report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The refusal of a majority of debt holders to accept MannKind equity ahead of the Aug. 15 deadline forced the company to roll over $32 million in unsettled debt until the end of September and try another stock-for-debt exchange. It's unclear if debt holders will be more amenable to accepting MannKind stock this time around.

Keeping track of the details and numbers is a challenge but here's a simple summary of MannKind's original proposal, announced on July 29, to extinguish the $100 million debt: 1. $28 million rolled over into new, 2018 debt; 2. $57 million converted into MannKind equity; and 3. $15 million repaid with company cash.

That effort failed, so MannKind's Plan B to knock out the $100 million in debt, announced on Aug. 13, looks like this: 1. $28 million rolled over into new, 2018 debt (done); 2. $8 million converted into MannKind equity (done); 3. $32 million converted into MannKind equity (ongoing); and 4. $32 million repaid with company cash (ongoing).

If all goes right, MannKind will use more than twice as much cash ($32 million) to settle the debt than planned originally ($15 million).

If the $32 million in debt cannot be converted into equity, MannKind will be forced to use even more cash, the company warned in its most recent 10-Q.

Worst-case scenario: MannKind could be forced to use $64 million in cash to settle the August 2015 debt, if the stock-for-debt exchange scheme fails again. The company had $107 million in cash on hand as of June 30, of which $25 million is restricted and cannot be touched due to other outstanding debt obligations. Factor in normal operating expenses and MannKind would be essentially insolvent unless a $30 million ""rescue"" loan available to the company from founder Al Mann is utilized.

Meantime, MannKind's debt owed to Sanofi under the Afrezza marketing joint venture grew by $12.8 million in the second quarter and now totals $28.4 million.

At the end of June, MannKind's total stockholders' deficit was $115 million, up from $74 million at the end of 2014."

318,"In the summer of 2007, early signs of distress in the United States housing market signaled the beginning of what Ben Bernanke, then the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, would later describe as “the worst financial crisis in global history, including the Great Depression.” Today, almost eight years later, much of the world is still wrestling with the effects of what proved to be “the deepest post World War II recession by far.”

Among many other things, the financial crisis spawned a vigorous public dialogue on the steps that should be taken to prevent any comparable calamity in the future and led to the enactment of a mass of new regulation of financial institutions. Beginning in 2009, as the global financial system emerged from the crisis and began a slow and uneven process of recovery, extensive reforms to the system were set in motion by measures adopted in the U.S., Europe, and, through the G-20, in other significant financial centers around the world. Though there is broad agreement that much remains to be done to implement these reforms, many wise and well-informed participants in global finance now believe that the critical strategic work of reform has been substantially accomplished. This view is exemplified by recent comments by Mark Carney, the highly respected Governor of the Bank of England and Chairman of the Financial Stability Board, who characterized the G-20 meeting in Brisbane, Australia in November 2014 as a “landmark,” and expressed the view that the “prudential requirement and supervisory framework for banking are largely settled . . . [I]t is now a question of implementation . . . [of] the agreed reform [that will make] the system safer . . . , simpler . . . [and] fairer.”

Although this confidence is cheering, I fear it is misplaced. While there has surely been significant progress, a great deal of important work lies ahead to meet the challenges that the global financial system will face in the course of the next decade. This paper offers a perspective on those challenges and the steps that can be taken to address them. Part I briefly reviews, for the purpose of general background, the context and causes of the financial crisis. Part II identifies the key lessons to be learned from the crisis, and Part III outlines the major reforms adopted to date in the United States, Europe and the G-20. Finally, Part IV highlights what I regard as the principal ongoing issues affecting the financial system and suggests some approaches for dealing with them.

With the benefit of hindsight, it is now widely agreed that the housing and mortgage market in the United States had developed in ways that set the stage for a bursting bubble. For more than a quarter century, U.S. housing policy had promoted home ownership as a milestone for the middle class in its pursuit of the American dream. By 2004, the members of 69% of U.S. households owned their homes, up from 64% just ten years before. From 2000 to 2007, the average price of a home doubled. Although incomes were stagnant during this period, the aggregate amount of mortgage debt also doubled and the average mortgage obligation rose 63%, from $91,500 to $149,500.5 During the same period, mortgage practices deteriorated sharply, especially with respect to low-income borrowers with weak credit histories. Access to credit was easy for these “sub-prime” borrowers, with loans often made without proof of income or other customary documentation and without the requirement of any down payment, at variable or special low initial interest rates. Innovations in securitization of mortgage loans further expanded access to credit, including borrowings by consumers of limited means for speculative investments in additional homes in resort communities. As home prices maintained their seemingly inexorable rise, mortgage securities spread throughout the financial system, with different tranches or slices of mortgage pools providing variable risks to different types of investors.

2266,"A Texas company has filed its second lawsuit in a week against local appraisers it says purposely overvalued a house, this time in Hammond.

Llano Financing Group of Austin, Texas, say in their new lawsuit, filed Monday in the U.S. District Court in Hammond, that Valparaiso appraisers Steve Wenger and Christine Wenger overvalued a Hammond house, at 3254 Kenwood St., in 2006.

The Wengers could not be reached for comment.

The Wengers were hired to appraise the house after a buyer applied for a loan of $113,400 in order to buy the property.

The Wengers appraised the property at $126,000 in October 2006, and the lender, Flick Mortgage Investors Inc., approved the loan based on the appraisal, the lawsuit claims.

The buyer eventually foreclosed on the loan, however, and Llano, which claims it has an ownership interest in the loan, says in the lawsuit that it discovered the value of the property was ""far less than $126,000.""

The lawsuit is similar to another one Llano filed on Thursday, this one against two appraisers from Hobart and Angola for an appraisal they did of a house in Gary. That lawsuit also claimed they had overvalued the house.

Both lawsuits claim that because the houses were not worth the value of the loans, the loan were under-secured and the the company lost money because it couldn't recover the full value of the loans.

Llano is is asking for unspecified damages. The lawsuit also lists ASAP Appraisal Service, a Valparaiso company that lists Christine Wenger as its representative, as a defendant."
1987,"A Las Vegas financial advisor, Edwin Fujinaga, and two of his associates were indicted July 8 by a federal grand jury for allegedly running a $1.5 billion Ponzi scheme.

If convicted, this may be the latest example of a scam popularized by con man Charles Ponzi in the 1920s. In fact, Ponzi schemes remain so widespread that a new case was discovered every five days in 2014 on average, according to Ponzitracker, amounting to $1.5 billion in potential losses for victims.

Here's a look at some of the most infamous Ponzi schemers caught in cons that were too good to be true."
2161,"Federal Judge Lucy Koh has approved a $415 million settlement by Apple, Google, Adobe and Intel related to agreements not to poach each other's employees.

Apple, Google, Intel, and Adobe will shell out $415 million to put to rest an antipoaching civil lawsuit that accused the companies of conspiring not to hire each other's employees.

On Wednesday, US District Judge Lucy Koh ruled that the settlement was ""fair, adequate, and reasonable"" for the thousands of plaintiffs involved in the class action suit. The $415 million settlement was proposed by the four tech companies in January after Koh had rejected a previous attempt to settle the case for $324.5 million on the grounds that the employees harmed by the antipoaching policy deserved more money. In March, Koh already appeared to be leaning toward approving the $415 million settlement.

Filed by former employees of the companies involved, the lawsuit shed a light on the practice of some major tech industry players of allegedly working together to agree not to poach employees from each other. The affected employees had argued that such agreements limited their ability to rise up in the industry and stifled their attempts to earn higher salaries. Email exchanges among such top executives as late Apple co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs and former Google CEO and now executive chairman of Alphabet Eric Schmidt revealed how requests were made not to hire certain employees away from each other.

One email exchange recounted how Jobs asked Schmidt to stop Google from trying to hire one of Apple's engineers.

""I would be very pleased if your recruiting department would stop doing this,"" Jobs wrote to Schmidt on March 7, 2007.

Schmidt then sent the request on, saying ""I believe we have a policy of no recruiting from Apple and this is a direct inbound request. Can you get this stopped and let me know why this is happening? I will need to send a response back to Apple quickly so please let me know as soon as you can.""

In the January motion to settle the case, the companies continued to deny that they had done anything wrong or violated any laws.

""We deny the allegations contained in the suit and we deny that we violated any laws or that we have any obligation to the plaintiff,"" Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy said in an emailed statement at the time. ""We elected to settle the matter in order to avoid the risk, burdens and uncertainty of ongoing litigation.""

Apple, Google and Intel declined CNET's request for comment on the settlement. A spokesperson for Adobe sent CNET the following statement:

Attorneys representing the plaintiffs had requested around $81 million in fees. But Koh nixed that amount, saying it would be a ""windfall"" for the lawyers and instead awarded them $40 million.

Movie studios Lucasfilm and Pixar and financial software and services company Intuit were part of the original lawsuit filed in 2011, but those companies settled with the plaintiffs in 2014 by agreeing to pay out $20 million spread among the three of them.

The case started when a former Lucasfilm software engineer filed a lawsuit alleging that the seven companies involved conspired to keep salaries low by agreeing not to poach one another's employees. Other complaints followed and were eventually combined into a single class action lawsuit that covered almost 65,000 employees who worked for the seven companies between 2005 and 2010.

The suit itself followed a 2009 antitrust investigation into the companies by the US Department of Justice. That matter was settled the following year, with the companies ending their agreements not to ""cold call"" employees of the other firms involved in an attempt to hire them."
1656,"Gold futures took a turn lower after switching between gains and losses on the heels of a Friday jobs report that offered a mixed picture of the health of the U.S. labor market.

The U.S. economy in August saw its smallest employment gains in five months, according to the Labor Department, adding a modest 173,000 new jobs, while unemployment fell to 5.1%—its lowest level since April 2008.

On its face, the data may provide no clear guidance for those hoping to gather insight about the Federal Reserve’s plan for normalizing interest rates.

Although the payrolls rise was lower than economists’ projections, upward revisions to prior months and the lowest unemployment rate in about seven years may offer little cause for the Fed to delay raising rates for the first time in nearly a decade at its two-day policy meeting beginning Sept. 16.

The employment data come shortly after Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Richmond Fed, said the central bank would be willing to lift rates regardless of a weak report.

Immediately after the jobs report, gold turned into positive territory but soon returned to negative territory.

Gold futures for December delivery GCZ5, -0.50% were lower, losing about $6.50, or 0.6%, to $1,118 an ounce, after posting a second straight decline in Thursday’s session ahead of the nonfarm payrolls report. Gold is on pace for a 1.5% weekly decline

Fawad Razaqzada, analyst at Forex.com, described the initial jump for gold as a “knee-jerk” reaction to the report but said the data wasn’t weak enough to support gold at higher levels.

A strengthening dollar provided additional headwinds for the dollar-denominated precious metal as currency investors pushed the greenback higher against its main rivals in early Thursday trade.

“I think the dollar is finding support and gold may have to fall back,” Razaqzada said soon after the jobs report was released. A stronger dollar is a drag on dollar-denominated gold, making the precious metal less attractive to buyers in other currencies.

A strengthening dollar put pressure on gold in Thursday trade after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi signaled the ECB was prepared to expand monetary stimulus if needed to help boost the region’s economy amid worries about a slowdown in emerging markets like China.

Read: Here’s why Mario Draghi sent the euro spiraling lower

Beyond jobs and a stronger dollar, analysts at Nomura believes that weak demand for gold is reining in the metal’s price, which had moved off its recent lows of around $1,085 an ounce, on the back of worries about tough economic times for China’s economy.

“Although gold futures and import data have improved, our metals and mining analysts think it is still too early to see a significant price rebound, as underlying consumer demand appears absent and the Fed’s decision is capping the upside,” said Nomura in a Friday note.

In other metals, December silver SIZ5, -1.10%  lost 5 cents, or 0.4%, to trade at $14.66 an ounce. Silver is on track for a 0.3% weekly drop."

""We rate HORMEL FOODS CORP (HRL) a BUY. This is based on the convergence of positive investment measures, which should help this stock outperform the majority of stocks that we rate. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its revenue growth, largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures, notable return on equity, good cash flow from operations and solid stock price performance.

237,"Esterline Corporation ESL, -5.54% (www.esterline.com), a leading specialty manufacturer serving the global aerospace and defense markets, today reported results for the fiscal third quarter ended July 31, 2015. Consolidated revenue of $496.2 million declined 2.0% compared with the year-ago period of $506.3 million. Foreign currency impacts were offset by sales from the Defense, Aerospace, and Training display business (DAT) acquired from Barco N.V. in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. Excluding these items, organic sales volume declined by 2.8%.

GAAP earnings from continuing operations in the third fiscal quarter of 2015 were $30.2 million, or $0.97 per diluted share, compared with $39.8 million, or $1.22 per diluted share, in the prior-year period. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 were $41.2 million, or $1.33 per diluted share. This excludes $0.26 per diluted share related to the company's previously disclosed integration and compliance activities and $0.10 per diluted share from the impact of DAT purchase accounting and integration costs (see Table 1).

Curtis Reusser, Esterline's Chief Executive Officer, said, ""During the third quarter we continued our work to reshape Esterline into a stronger company with increased efficiencies that will bring added value to our stakeholders. Activities this quarter included an important restructuring of our executive team and further advancement of our E3 operational excellence program. We were pleased to see solid improvement in our operating margins in the third quarter compared with the first half of this fiscal year."" Reusser continued, ""Our end markets are fundamentally healthy and commercial aerospace, in particular, is supported by strong orders at the OEM level and robust airline profitability. In the short term, early 2016 sales growth could remain challenged, as most commercial aerospace production rates have stabilized and energy and general industrial markets are still under pressure.""

Including discontinued operations, net earnings for the fiscal third quarter of 2015 were $28.5 million, or $0.92 per diluted share, compared with $38.9 million, or $1.19 per diluted share, in the prior-year period. Net earnings in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 included a $1.7 million loss from discontinued operations, while the prior-year period included a $0.9 million loss from discontinued operations.

New orders in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 were $508.7 million, including $49.3 million from DAT, compared with $515.1 million in the year-ago period. Backlog at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2015 was $1.28 billion, compared with $1.25 billion at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2014. Third quarter backlog for 2015 includes $190.8 million from DAT.

Gross margin as a percentage of sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 was 34.2%, compared with 35.0% in the prior-year period. The lower gross margin relative to the prior year primarily reflects lower sales volumes and unfavorable sales mix in Avionics & Controls and Advanced Materials.

Fiscal third quarter selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense as a percentage of sales was 18.5%, compared with the prior-year level of 17.6%. Higher SG&A was attributable to the addition of DAT and increased compliance costs. On an adjusted basis that excludes incremental compliance costs and the DAT impact, fiscal third quarter 2015 SG&A expense as a percentage of sales was 16.4%, compared with an adjusted prior-year level of 17.1%. Foreign exchange translation drove part of this improvement.

During the fiscal third quarter the company incurred integration and certain pre-tax incremental compliance costs of $9.9 million; $7.1 million was reported in SG&A expense, $1.4 million was reflected in gross margin, and $1.4 million was reported as restructuring charges. In the prior-year period for these activities, the company incurred pre-tax costs of $7.7 million; $3.4 million was reported as restructuring charges, $2.3 million was reported in SG&A expense, and $2.0 million was reflected in gross margin. The company's integration efforts remain on track.

Research, development and engineering (R&D) spending in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 was $29.2 million, or 5.9% of sales, compared with $24.3 million, or 4.8% of sales, in the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of DAT, the company's R&D was 4.6% of sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. The company expects full-year R&D spending to be approximately 5.5% of sales.

The company's income tax rate in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 was 17.4%, compared with 23.7% in the prior-year period. The lower tax rate was driven by higher discrete tax benefits and the DAT net loss. The company expects the full-year income tax rate for fiscal 2015 to be approximately 20%.

Cash flow from operations was $104.2 million through the nine months ended July 31, 2015, driving strong free cash flow conversion at 116% of net income. The company repurchased 1.4 million shares in the fiscal 2015 third quarter for $132.2 million. Since the company launched its share repurchase program in July 2014, it has repurchased 2.8 million shares for $289.8 million. The company's total approved share repurchase level is $400 million.

Through the third fiscal quarter of 2015, sales decreased 4.0% to $1.4 billion, compared with $1.5 billion in the prior year. Year-to-date foreign currency translation effects were mostly offset by sales from the recently acquired DAT operations. Excluding these items, organic sales volumes declined by 3.5% in the first nine months of fiscal 2015.

Year-to-date GAAP earnings from continuing operations were $76.9 million, or $2.44 per diluted share, compared with $114.4 million, or $3.53 per diluted share, in the prior-year period. Excluding discrete costs described in Table 2 below, adjusted earnings from continuing operations through the third fiscal quarter of 2015 were $106.5 million, or $3.38 per diluted share, compared with the adjusted year-ago period results of $131.3 million, or $4.05 per diluted share.

The company has updated its full-year guidance for the 11-month fiscal year ended October 2, 2015, to reflect third quarter results and expectations for the fiscal fourth quarter. The company expects full-year revenue to be in a range of $1.78 billion to $1.80 billion, including approximately $100 million from DAT. Full-year adjusted earnings from continuing operations, which incorporates $3.38 per diluted share for year-to-date adjusted results, are expected in a range of $4.35 to $4.45 per diluted share. The updated adjusted earnings per share guidance excludes fiscal fourth quarter costs expected for integration and compliance, expenses related to the 7% Senior Note redemption, and costs associated with DAT purchase accounting and integration.

Esterline will host a conference call to discuss this announcement today at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time (2:00 p.m. Pacific Time). The U.S. dial-in number is 1-866-953-6859; outside the U.S., use 617-399-3483. The pass code for the call is: 53962953. The company has posted a presentation on its website (www.esterline.com) under ""Presentations"" in the Investor Relations section to provide additional information about its third fiscal quarter operational and financial results. The presentation is also included as Exhibit 99.2 to the company's report on Form 8-K, which is being submitted today to the SEC.

This press release and the related presentation providing supplemental financial information include non-GAAP financial measures -- adjusted earnings from continuing operations, adjusted earnings from continuing operations per diluted share, adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT), adjusted SG&A expense as a percentage of sales, adjusted R&D expense as a percentage of sales, adjusted gross margin, and free cash flow conversion -- that have not been calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (GAAP). Adjusted earnings from continuing operations consists of earnings from continuing operations attributable to Esterline less the costs associated with certain integration activities -- including restructuring charges -- and incremental compliance costs as well as discrete items associated with our acquisition of the DAT business in January 2015, adjustments to reserves on long-term contracts incurred in the periods presented and unique amounts related to pension expense and a non-income tax gain, in each case, as further detailed in the tables below. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations per diluted share divides each element of adjusted earnings from continuing operations by the weighted average number of shares outstanding, diluted for the periods presented. EBIT is defined as operating earnings from continuing operations. Adjusted EBIT excludes the same costs excluded from adjusted earnings from continuing operations and excludes DAT sales of $32 million from GAAP sales. Fiscal third quarter 2015 adjusted SG&A expense as a percentage of sales excludes the cost of certain compliance costs of $7 million as well as DAT's SG&A expense of $9 million from GAAP SG&A. The calculation also excludes DAT's sales from GAAP sales. Fiscal third quarter 2014 adjusted SG&A expense as a percentage of sales excludes the cost of certain integration and compliance costs of $2 million from GAAP SG&A. Adjusted R&D as a percentage of sales excludes $8 million of DAT R&D expense from GAAP R&D and excludes DAT sales from GAAP sales. Adjusted gross margin excludes the cost of certain integration activities and DAT's gross margin from GAAP gross margin and excludes DAT's sales from GAAP sales. Year-to-date 2015 free cash flow conversion is calculated by dividing free cash flow of $66 million (cash flow from operations of $104 million less capital expenditures of $38 million) by net earnings of $57 million. In accordance with the SEC's requirements, below is the reconciliation of the non-GAAP adjusted earnings from continuing operations to the comparable GAAP earnings from continuing operations.

The company provides these non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental information to our GAAP financial measures. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to (a) evaluate the company's historical and prospective financial performance and its performance relative to its competitors, (b) allocate resources, and (c) measure the operational performance of the company's business units.

109,"During the secular bull market in Gold, one of the strongest arguments cited in its favour was the currency devaluation that took place in the United States. That rubbed off positively on the gold prices and created expectations of a never-ending bull market.However, in the last few years, Gold price has declined by almost 45 per cent from its peak seen in 2011.It is quite a setback for bullion bulls to see the biggest of central banks embarking on large monetary policy easing but Gold unable to respond in a similar manner. In the last few quarters, European Central Bank introduced a large monetary easing by purchasing bonds. Bank of Japan continues to follow loose monetary policy through ""Abenomics"".Recently, China has come forward as the most aggressive central bank to have become dovish and loosen its monetary policy. It has cut its benchmark interest rates 5 times in the last 9 months, cut reserve ration requirements, weakened its currency and added liquidity to its banking system.This colossal amount of new money into the system has not favoured Gold in an appreciable manner even as US Federal Reserve has kept its Zero Interest Rate Policy (ZIRP) intact till now. This clearly indicates that globally, safe-haven appeal of Gold has diminished to a large extent and its investment demand is slack.The recent surge to six-week highs in gold was largely the result of short covering from $1,075/oz to $1,170/oz at COMEX and from Rs 24500/10 gm to Rs 27700/10gm in domestic markets, in which traders bought to offset bearish positions, after currency and stock market instability, continued weakness in China's currency after a devaluation this month, and thoughts that the events may cause the Federal Reserve to postpone tightening of monetary policy.We're in a market where commodities have generally come under pressure, particularly those with exposure to China. As a financial asset, there's a temptation to take some money out of that to cover losses elsewhere.There has been some positivity surrounding Gold as insurance, but that can't outweigh everything else. This short-term uptick in Gold may well serve as an entry point for an eventual break of $1000.A recovery in the US equity markets and positive economic data are taking some momentum away from Gold prices and it looks like prices have made short-term top and will continue to be weak due to the following factors:- It's a disinflationery environment, a low-growth environment, which is negative for commodities. Emerging currency markets are still in turmoil early this week, which is by itself a very worrisome development for the world marketplace.- Adding to the uncertainty in the marketplace at present is whether or not the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its September FOMC meeting. After this week's extremely volatile price action in many markets, there are growing doubts the Fed will be able to make a rate hike in September, or even this year.- Gold has failed to rally in the face of China's stock market crisis as investors, scorched by a brutal end to the market's 12-year bull run, chose cash and bonds for safety over bullion while they seek clarity on the timing of a US rate increase.- Despite the policy action from China (interest rate & RRR cut), the weakening outlook for global growth may continue to foster a bearish outlook for the precious metal as demand falters.- Technically, Gold prices reversed from important resistance of $1,170, which was 100DMA and 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of downtrend from $1,225 to $1,075. If prices sustain below $1,125, technical setup would turn more bearish, targeting $1,100 and eventually a move towards $1,000. Momentum indicators have also reversed from overbought condition and suggest a breakdown in prices.(The author is Chief Market Strategist, Edelweiss Financial Services.

1501,"Eastern Ontario residents who use natural gas would likely see their wintertime bills jump by an average of nearly 12 per cent if the planned Energy East pipeline proceeds, says a report released Thursday by the Ontario Energy Board.

The report also raises concerns about the potential impact of the pipeline, which will pass through rural areas in Ottawa’s south end, on sensitive waterways, singling out the Ottawa River, Rideau River and the Nepean and Oxford-Marsh aquifers for special mention.

The $2.4-million OEB report, commissioned by the Ontario government, concludes there’s an imbalance between the economic and environmental risks of TransCanada’s proposed $12-billion pipeline and the “modest” economic benefits it would produce for Ontarians.

The project involves converting 3,000 kilometres of existing natural gas pipeline to carry 1.1 million barrels per day of crude oil from Alberta and constructing a new 1,600-kilometre pipeline from Iroquois, Ont. to Saint John, N.B.

In Ontario, about 1,900 kilometres of existing 42-inch natural gas pipeline in northern and eastern Ontario would be converted and an additional 100 kilometres of new pipeline built from Iroquois to the Quebec border.

A technical study done for the OEB found the conversion would create insufficient capacity along a section of the pipeline running from North Bay to Iroquois.

“This will reduce the supply of natural gas and is expected to lead to price increases in Eastern Ontario,” the OEB report says.

During the winter months, when demand is highest, Energy East would likely increase the price of gas by an average of 11.9 per cent between 2016 and 2035, the OEB says. Because there would no impact in summer, the average price increase would be 3.5 per cent over a full year.

To deal with the anticipated shortfall in pipeline capacity needed to meet forecast demand in Eastern Ontario, TransCanada is proposing to build a new natural gas pipeline from Maple, Ont. to Cornwall.

But even with that new pipeline, the OEB says it is concerned that Energy East “will reduce the supply and increase the price of natural gas” for consumers in Eastern Ontario.

The OEB finding vindicates a 2013 warning by Enbridge Gas Distribution, which said Energy East would leave it as much as 25 per cent short of the capacity needed to serve the Ottawa area on the coldest winter days.

In a statement responding to the OEB report, TransCanada was silent about Energy East’s potential impact on natural gas prices in Eastern Ontario.

The company said the project is still in the early stages of the design and regulatory process overseen by the National Energy Board, which is expected to hold a public hearing in 2016.

“As such, certain aspects of the project will continue to be refined based on technical studies planned or underway, as well as the results of extensive ongoing public consultations,” it said.

The OEB report followed public consultations in January 2014 and January 2015, described by the board as the most comprehensive it has ever undertaken.

Adam Scott, a spokesman for Environmental Defence, said the public input the OEB received “made it clear that the risky project does not have the support of communities along the pipeline route in Ontario — especially in the Ottawa area.”

The public’s biggest concern was the safety of the proposed pipeline and its potential impact on the province’s lakes, rivers and drinking water in the event of a spill, the OEB said.

The Energy East pipeline would cross or run parallel to many Ontario waterways, including the Ottawa, Mattawa, Madawaska, Rideau and St. Lawrence rivers, the board report notes.

It says TransCanada “needs to assess whether it is appropriate to take a route originally chosen for a natural gas pipeline and use it for the transportation of crude oil.

“Where the existing pipeline route is too close to environmentally sensitive areas, TransCanada should reroute the pipeline or justify why rerouting is not necessary.”

The report says TransCanada “should pay particular attention” to Nipigon Lake, Trout Lake, the Ottawa River, the Rideau River and the Nepean and Oxford-Marsh aquifers, which supply well water for rural areas of Ottawa and Eastern Ontario.

TransCanada should be using the latest leak detection systems for Energy East and should demonstrate that, in the event of a spill, as little crude oil as reasonably practicable would be released, the report says.

The report cited three studies done of Energy East’s estimated economic impact in Ontario. They show that, directly and indirectly, the project will create between 92,668 and 114,000 full-time equivalent jobs and add between $12 billion and $19 billion to the province’s GDP.

The report characterized those benefits as modest, though it acknowledged that the pipeline’s long-term economic impacts “cannot be quantified with any certainty.

“Regardless, we believe there is an imbalance between the risk of the project and the expected benefits for Ontarians,” the OBE says.

“While there may be economic benefits, Energy East has costs and risks that Ontarians, and the province’s natural gas consumers, do not currently have to bear.”

The Ontario government, which has no regulatory authority over the pipeline project, will use the OEB study’s findings to inform its arguments when it intervenes at the National Energy Board’s hearing into Energy East."
2121,"Federal regulators Tuesday announced a $750,000 settlement with Smart City Holdings LLC for blocking consumers’ Wi-Fi at various convention centers around the United States, including Cincinnati’s.

Smart City, an Internet and telecommunications provider for conventions, meeting centers, and hotels, had been blocking personal mobile “hotspots” that were being used by convention visitors and exhibitors who used their own data plans rather than paying Smart City substantial fees to use the company’s Wi-Fi service.

“It is unacceptable for any company to charge consumers exorbitant fees to access the Internet while at the same time blocking them from using their own personal Wi-Fi hotspots to access the Internet,” said Travis LeBlanc, chief of the Federal Communication Commission’s enforcement bureau, in a news release. “All companies who seek to use technologies that block FCC-approved Wi-Fi connections are on notice that such practices are patently unlawful.”

The FCC said that in providing service at convention centers, Smart City charged exhibitors and visitors a fee of $80 to access the company’s Wi-Fi services for a single day. An FCC investigation revealed that, if exhibitors or visitors to the convention centers did not pay this $80 fee, Smart City would automatically block users from accessing the Internet when they instead attempted to use their personal cellular data plans to establish mobile Wi-Fi networks – or “hotspots” – to connect their Wi-Fi enabled devices to the Internet.

As part of the settlement, Smart City will cease its Wi-Fi blocking activities and will pay a $750,000 civil penalty.

In June 2014, the FCC received an informal complaint that consumers could not connect to the Internet at several venues where Smart City provided Wi-Fi service. The enforcement bureau’s investigation revealed that Smart City automatically blocked consumers from using their own “rogue” Wi-Fi networks at several convention centers the company serves, including convention centers here and in Columbus; Indianapolis; Orlando, Florida; and Phoenix, Arizona. No evidence exists that the Wi-Fi blocking occurred in response to a specific security threat to Smart City’s network or the users of its network, the FCC said.

The action was the FCC’s second major enforcement action regarding Wi-Fi blocking. In October 2014, the commission fined Marriott International Inc. and Marriott Hotel Services Inc. $600,000 for similar Wi-Fi blocking activities at the Gaylord Opryland Hotel and Convention Center in Nashville, Tennessee."
1538,"Falling natural gas prices will mean the smallest average bills in a decade for thousands of Clark and Champaign county customers this winter.

Customers on Columbia Gas of Ohio’s budget payment plan will likely average $62.88 per month this winter, said Shanelle Hinkle-Moore, the company’s external affairs specialist. That price is down from an average of about $80 per month last year.

“This is the lowest average projected amount in nearly a decade,” she said. “These lower costs are a reflection of the lower cost of natural gas.”

The budget plan allows customers to spread the cost of their heating bills evenly throughout the year, and allows a customer’s bills to remain the same each month. It was designed to help take the guesswork out bills for customers that choose to enroll.

The company has about 39,000 customers overall in Clark County and about 5,400 in Champaign County.

Budget accounts still vary for each customer, depending on issues like historical gas usage patterns, the projected cost of natural gas on the wholesale market and rates for service and delivery. The company can also adjust payment amounts to keep them on track with actual balances.

The company serves about 15, 900 customers in the local service area, which includes parts of Logan, Champaign, Clark and Madison counties. Columbus Gas serves about 1.4 million customers statewide.

In general, the heating season can be tough for many residents, particularly low-income families, said Bowen Chaney, HEAP program director at Opportunities for Individual Change of Clark County. The agency serves as the Community Action Agency for Clark County residents, administering programs that include the Department of Development’s Home Energy Assistance Program and Emergency HEAP program.

The programs provide assistance to help cover utility costs to residents who meet income and other requirements, Chaney said. The lower natural energy prices have little direct impact on the HEAP programs, he said.

But OIC also often acts as an intermediary between utility companies and county residents who need assistance. The agency often helps consumers enroll in budget plans once they regain some financial stability.

The HEAP program runs between November and March and typically serves about 3,000 residents annually, Chaney said."
252,"Provincial Finance Minister Carlos Leitao announced the change in fiscal policy on Thursday morning at the commencement of a commission on Quebec's fiscal policy.

The minister said that a one percentage point increase in the TVQ would generate about $1 billion in revenue for the province.

Before increasing the sales tax, the province would lower income taxes by an equivalent amount, effectively creating a revenue-neutral policy.

Leitao was appearing before a parliamentary commission chaired by University of Sherbrooke economist Luc Godbout.

He anticipated the changes would be tabled in the next provincial budget, and be fully implemented by 2018.

Leitao said the overall effect of the policy would be to increase household revenue and increase the Gross Domestic Product for the province.

1793,"LAUNCESTON, Australia, Sept 1 China's various purchasing managers' indexes gather significant attention as indicators of the health of the world's second-biggest economy, but they are less useful as a predictor of commodity imports.

The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to a 3-year low of 49.7 in August, in line with market expectations and down from a reading of 50 in July.

The drop below the 50-level that separates expansion from contraction will be viewed as another sign that China is struggling for growth momentum, and raises further questions over whether 2015's official target of a 7-percent increase in gross domestic product can be realized.

The Caixin/Markit PMI dropped to 47.3 in August, the weakest since 2009 and down from 47.8 in July.

The official PMI focuses on large, state-controlled companies, while the Caixin/Markit measure encompasses more small- and medium-sized enterprises.

In theory, the weakening of the PMIs should spell gloom for commodity import volumes, but it may not be as dire as feared.

While PMI readings below 50 are certainly a negative for China's commodity demand, history suggests that the prevailing price and stockpiling demand are more important drivers of imports.

At the beginning of 2013 the official PMI was at 50.4 and it climbed as high as 51.7 in July 2014 before weakening to 49.8 in January this year, rallying a tad to 50.2 by May and then dropping to the current low.

In other words, the PMI has traded either side of the 50-level, with the trend being downwards for the past 12 months.

In contrast, imports of crude oil have been trending higher since the start of 2013, rising from 25.15 million tonnes in January of that year to 30.71 million in July this year, the third month in the past eight where they have topped 30 million.

Over the same period, iron ore imports have also been trending higher, jumping from 65.54 million tonnes in January 2013 to 86.01 million tonnes in July this year.

Whilst it is true that iron ore imports are showing no growth in the first seven months of the year compared to the same period last year, the point is that they are tracking up at a far higher level than they were two years ago, whilst the PMI has gone sideways and weaker.

There appears to be a far stronger correlation between iron ore imports and the spot price in Asia.

At the start of 2013, iron ore was at $144.90 a tonne, and since reaching $158.90 in February that year, it has trended downwards, dropping to $55.70 on Monday.

While iron prices did decline over 2013, the pace accelerated in 2014, and it was also then that China started ramping up more of the steel-making ingredient.

The lower price of iron ore was prompted by the massive expansions of mines in Australia, but the Chinese response was to buy more as their own mines reduced output as they slipped into losses.

With crude oil, imports again surged in 2014 and have maintained momentum this year, after Brent crude fell dramatically from July 2014 onwards, after a period of relative stability in 2013.

Brent lost as much of 63 percent of its value between late June 2014 and the recent closing low of $42.69 a barrel on Aug. 24.

The sustained lower price has coincided with China boosting imports in order to fill strategic storage, suggesting that price has been a factor in increasing purchases as it's possible that if crude had remained at elevated levels, the Chinese could have deferred purchases until they deemed the price was more competitive.

What the numbers show is that the price appears to be a bigger determinant of China's commodity imports than the level of the PMI.

Of course, this doesn't apply evenly to all commodities, take coal for example.

Imports have weakened considerably this year even though the price remains depressed, but this is likely more due to a structural shift lower in China's demand as Beijing battles pollution and seeks to limit the use of dirtier fuels.

But overall, commodity imports are likely to hold up as long as prices remain relatively low and the Chinese economy does record growth, even if that growth is soft as indicated by the PMIs.

Independent sources in London and Port Moresby have pointed to plans for a hostile approach set to be made by the Australian player, despite an obvious hurdle in the shape of the PNG government's stake in Oil Search.

1948,"The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has sued Carlos Garza, a former employee of defunct GAW Miners and brother of former CEO Josh Garza.

The suit confirms months-long rumors about SEC action on the matter. The regulator likely subpoenaed Carlos Garza because the whereabouts of his brother, Josh, are unknown. The SEC said that it is questioning Carlos due to his apparent knowledge of the inner workings at GAW.

The SEC is investigating whether GAW violated securities laws through the sale of its Hashlet miners and its cryptocurrency, Paycoin. It is also looking into whether GAW operated as a Ponzi scheme by selling more hashing power than it was capable of producing.

Carlos Garza has thus far refused to cooperate with the investigation. “Garza appeared for testimony but refused to answer any questions. Garza also failed to produce any documents requested in the subpoena, including a document he had earlier represented that he would produce.,” charges the SEC.

Garza claimed he did not understand securities law and was uneasy answering questions without a lawyer present.

The United States District Court for Massachusetts has granted an SEC request requiring Garza to either comply with the subpoena or supply proof demonstrating why he cannot appear by September 4.

As one of the most brazen scams in cryptocurrency to date, GAW burst onto the crypto scene last summer with a series of major announcements, including very cheap miners (Hashlets) and multimillion dollar acquisitions (BTC.com) and mergers (ZenMiner).

It suddenly transitioned away from its Hashlet business last fall into the world of payments. It was promised that ‘PayBase’ had forged strategic partnerships with retailers like Walmart and Amazon. ‘Paycoin’, “the people’s money”, would be accepted by these retailers, and was guaranteed a price floor of $20 (it currently trades at $0.024).

The company frequently failed to deliver on its promises, and repeatedly denied making them in various contradictory statements. Negative commentary about the company on its discussion forum, Hashtalk, was suppressed and removed.

Josh Garza has been a no-show in lawsuits by former customers and the Mississippi Power Company (MPC), and there are reports that he sold his home in Massachusetts and fled the US.

The company collapsed in April. As recently as January, it was generally considered “controversial” in the media, and even received warm attention in mainstream media last November."
2519,"Earlier this week, City Pages ran the cover story The Broken Girl and a Mother's War with UnitedHealth, which chronicled allegations that the Minnesota insurance giant routinely denies mental health patients the coverage they paid for.

""Look at the money being made,"" said state Sen. John Marty (DFL-Roseville). ""You don't make those kinds of numbers without denying people the help they need.""

Judging by the company's financial statement, United is also hauling in big money through Obamacare.

Though conservatives denounced the health care law as nothing short of an attack on the free-market system, United has managed to till enormous profits. Annual proxy statements from the Minnetonka company show profits over the last five years approaching $27 billion. The past 12 months have been exceedingly flush at $6.11 billion in the black.

But such windfalls don't come by accident. Insurers were allowed a key role in negotiating the rules of Obamacare. For United, that's meant keeping both sides of the political machine lubricated to ensure no one forgets its interests.

According to the Sunlight Foundation, a nonprofit, nonpartisan group in Washington, D.C. that focuses on money and government influence, the carrier ranked 55th among America’s most politically active corporations between 2007 and 2012. UnitedHealth shelled out nearly $27 million to politicians, political parties, action committees, and lobbyists.

The carrier was most generous to President Barack Obama, giving him almost $300,000 by the second half of 2014. Former GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney cashed checks of more than $100,000. Former Minnesota Republican senator-turned-political operative Norm Coleman pulled in $84,000. Current Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar rounded out the top ten with contributions pushing $60,000.

In 2014 alone, United's political action committee slathered money on a list of people that runs 13 pages long.

It's the kind of generosity that gives you a lot of sway.

Insurers ""have a lot of clout to have laws written in their favor and have administrative decisions made that go easy on them,"" says Marty. ""That's the problem.""

Obamacare's marrow was written by Liz Fowler, chief health counsel to Senator Max Baucus (D-Montana), one of the biggest recipients of cash from the health care sector.

According to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit, nonpartisan research group in Washington, D.C., lobbyists for United gave more than $30,000 to Baucus between 2007 and June 2009, just as Fowler was writing the law.

That 30k was a wee part of the $380 million the industry spent on lobbying before the new health care law took effect.

As the New York Times noted, insurers are the “most direct beneficiaries of the law.”

And United has benefited from all sides of Obamacare.

When the HealthCare.gov website stumbled out of the gate, United’s subsidiary Optum was hired to help fix the problems.

Obamacare also gave the insurer greater access to customers. It added 4.5 million people to its roster of paying customers in 2013. Government programs, likewise, boosted the company's bottom line as it added 425,000 people to its Medicare Advantage rolls. Its Medicaid business added 205,000 customers that same year.

Last year proved even more lucrative as UnitedHealth's revenues from ""people served through state sponsored benefit programs"" grew by $5.3 billion.

UnitedHealth is the poster child for the nation's broken health care system, according to Marty.

""[Obamacare] gave insurance companies even more clout when they already had a lot of clout,"" he says.

647,"Overall employment and construction employment improved nationally in July on a seasonally adjusted (SA) basis. Meanwhile, as would be expected, not seasonally adjusted (NSA) construction employment increased from June. This resulted in 43 states posting a monthly decline in their estimated NSA construction unemployment rate.

With construction activity and employment continuing to advance from last year, the NSA construction unemployment rates for the country and 48 states were down in July on a year-over-year basis. Also, for the second month in a row, all state construction unemployment rates were under 10 percent.

For the first seven months of the year, construction added 108,000 SA jobs. At the same time, NSA jobs increased by 225,000 from July 2014 to July 2015.

  

 The Top Five States

  

 The five states with the lowest construction unemployment rates in order were:

* Unemployment rate is for construction, mining, and logging combined

Three of the top five states—Wyoming, North Dakota, and South Dakota—were also among the top five in June with a somewhat different order. Wyoming jumped to number one from number five in June based on revised data (Wyoming was previously reported as number six in June).

North Dakota retained its number two position based on revised data (it was previously reported as number three). Note, however, that on a year-over-year basis its rate increased by 0.6 percent. North Dakota and West Virginia were the only two states to experience a rise in their construction unemployment rate from a year ago. For both states, lower energy prices appear to have played a major role in the increase. In North Dakota's case, lower prices led to a reduction in exploration and drilling new oil wells. In West Virginia's case, environmental concerns along with the lower energy prices have taken a toll on the coal industry, a major contributor to the state's economy.

South Dakota fell from number one to number three. Maryland shot up to fourth place from eleventh place in June. Hawaii advanced from tied with Utah for ninth in June to number five in July.

Montana, which was ranked third in June based on revised data (previously reported as tied for fourth), slumped to ninth place in July. Idaho, which was originally tied with Montana for fourth lowest rate, had its rank lowered to sixth lowest in June based on revised data. In July, it fell to the 10th lowest rate. Nebraska sank from fourth place in June to eighth place in July.

  

 The Bottom Five States

  

 The six states with the highest construction unemployment rates (from lowest to highest) were:

Four of the six states with the highest construction unemployment rates in July—Rhode Island, Mississippi, Georgia, and West Virginia—were among the five highest in June. West Virginia had the highest construction unemployment rate in both June and July. Its June ranking is based on revised data. Previously, it had been ranked second highest along with Georgia.

Despite a sharp decline in its construction unemployment rate (down 1.3 percent from the month before and 3.1 percent from the year before) Georgia had the second highest rate in July after posting the third highest rate in June (originally reported as tied for second highest with West Virginia).

Mississippi improved to the third highest rate in the nation from the second highest rate in June, based on revised data. Previously, Mississippi was listed as the highest rate in June.

Rhode Island held its fourth highest position in July. The Ocean State was joined in this ranking by its neighbor Connecticut and Alabama. This was quite a drop for Connecticut, which was 17th highest (34th lowest) in June. Connecticut was one of five states, along with Idaho, Kansas, Minnesota, and Montana, that experienced an increase in its construction unemployment rate from June. Alabama was eighth highest in June.

In June, New Jersey had the fifth highest construction unemployment rate (based on revised data) along with New Mexico. For July, New Jersey came in at seventh highest while New Mexico improved to 22nd highest, tied with Oregon.

1175,"?Failed housing development, due to a declining real estate market, on the Rocky Creek land along the coast allowed the Pasco County Commission to add the 65 acres to a project list in 2009. Now, commissioners may buy the land with proceeds from the original Penny for Pasco sales tax to turn it into a public park preserve.

More than three decades ago, an Odessa couple wanted to take gulf-front property they owned and save it as a public park. If Pasco commissioners concur, the county plans to do just that by buying the island for $3.1 million.

The land, once known as Cotee Point for its proximity to the Pithlachascotee River, is now commonly called Rocky Creek after that tributary. Among the approximately two dozen sites on the county's environmental lands project list, Rocky Creek is ranked second highest, after Cross Bar/Al Bar ranch, for its environmental importance.

""Getting any undeveloped land on the coast is big,'' said Keith Wiley, manager of the county's Environmental Lands and Management Program, ELAMP.

Odessa ranchers Carl and Virginia Behnke no longer are the benefactors. The family couldn't come to terms with the state and county on a purchase in the late 1980s, and both have passed away. Their 50 acres are now owned by real estate investors who, 11 years ago, sought to turn the land into a gated upscale community with 44 single-family homes being marketed for more than $1 million apiece.

That plan spawned a controversial zoning case before the Port Richey City Council, lawsuits from the land owners, political fallout in the municipal elections and eventually a settlement that entitled the landowners as well as the owners of the adjoining 15 acres to develop 340 homes and condominiums, up from the 13 houses the city originally approved.

Development, however, never occurred amid a declining real estate market. In 2009, the County Commission agreed to add all 65 acres to its ELAMP project list and now is poised to consider a sales contract using proceeds from the original Penny for Pasco sales tax. If commissioners agree to the purchase, the county would have up to 60 days to close the deal. Evaluation of the land's potential for passive recreation would follow.

Local residents and statewide environmentalists lauded the effort to protect the land from the threat of development.

""You don't have to develop every inch of waterfront,'' said former Port Richey City Council member Jim Priest.

The sellers are the Port Richey 15 Property Trust, which owns 15 acres, and Altamonte G&M of Largo, which has the 50-acre parcel to the north. The property, off Ebbtide Lane in Port Richey, has forested uplands, wetlands, saltwater marshes and mangroves, and is adjacent to other undeveloped land owned by the Florida Audubon Society.

""The current regime in Tallahassee is not exactly strong on enforcing environmental laws and protecting our wetlands,'' said Charles Lee, director of advocacy for the Florida Audubon. ""The potential that somebody could come in with right lobbyist and the right engineer and broker a deal to fill that in is very real.''

Priest lauded the ecotourism potential in west Pasco and said Rocky Creek is a key part.

""Some of the greatest kayaking and stand-up paddleboarding exists in our area in and around that piece of property,'' said Priest. ""It never warranted development.''

Gill Dawg Marina in Port Richey, for instance, books glass-bottom kayak tours of the Rocky Creek mangroves.

""That Rocky Creek tour is one of the most common ones we do,'' said Gill Dawg owner Erik Suojanen. ""I'd hate to see that developed. I'd love to see Pasco County pick it up and preserve it.''"
2050,"The Hawks arrested nine fraudsters who gained access to a government-approved supplier database and placed illicit orders with the companies on the list.

Hawks spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi says 104 cases of defrauded government supplier companies have been reported.

Mulaudzi says the monetary value of the fraudulent transactions is unavailable; however, more cases are expected to be reported in the next few months.

""We believe this is the not the only syndicate that is doing this; we believe there are many others out there.""

Investigations are still ongoing, he says. ""We will be closing in on many others in the coming months.""

The suspects appeared in the Johannesburg Specialised Commercial Crime Court yesterday, on charges of fraud and theft.

Meanwhile, earlier this week, National Treasury introduced a Central Supplier Database (CSD) to address supplier duplication and corruption, as well as fraudulent orders.

Government currently has supplier information for all the different government departments, municipalities and public entities in 600 databases.

According to treasury, the CSD aims to be a consolidated source of all supplier information for all organs of state.

410,"NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Stock futures spiked on Thursday after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi struck a dovish tone.

S&P 500 futures were up 0.94%, Dow Jones Industrial Average futures added 0.94%, and Nasdaq futures gained 0.91%.

Draghi suggested in a press conference that the ECB was ready to take further monetary action if inflation continued to slow. He also noted that the ECB was ready to ""fully implement"" its asset-buying program which would run to Sept.16 or longer if needed. The ECB will increase the percentage of any single issue of bonds in its asset-buying program to 33% from 25%.

The European body also reduced inflation forecasts with 2015 inflation expected at just 0.1%, down from a June forecast of 0.3%. Next year, the ECB expects inflation of 1.1%, down from 1.5%.

2536,"""You have to understand accounting and you have to understand the nuances of accounting. It's the language of business and it's an imperfect language, but unless you are willing to put in the effort to learn accounting how to read and interpret financial statements you really shouldn't select stocks yourself.

Now that we've established how important accounting is for investors, let's take a look at the three primary financial statements an investor will wrestle with in trying to assess the quality of a business and its financial health:

Income statement ('Profit and Loss statement', 'P&L') 

The income statement is the financial statement that most investors focus on, because it provides a financial overview of a company's business activity over a specific period of time (quarterly or annually, generally).

The income statements begins at the top with the revenues (or 'sales') that a company generated over a period and works its down through the various costs the company incurred in the conduct of its operations in order to determine the company's profit:

Cost of sales: This the direct cost associated with producing the goods and/ or services that the company sold during the period. Subtracting the cost of sales from revenues gives the gross profit.  Operating costs (or 'operating expenses'): These are the costs incurred to support the company's operations that are not directly associated with the goods and services sold. These include, for example, the salaries of the human resources executives, research and development costs and the depreciation of equipment and other long-lived assets.

Subtracting operating costs from gross profit yields the income from operations ('operating income', 'operating profit' or EBIT -- earnings before interest and taxes). Dividing that figure by revenues is the operating margin – a key measure of profitability.

Left side: Assets, which reflects a compact accounting of the things the company owns and from which it derives its value. These include tangible assets such as plants, property and equipment, and intangible assets, such as patents and trademarks.  Right side: Liabilities and Shareholders' Equity, which describes the means by which the assets have been financed, either through debt and other owings (liabilities) or through the equity that shareholders stumped up, along with retained earnings (shareholders' equity).

In other words, the accounting value of a company that is attributable to its shareholders is equal to the total value of its assets less the value of all the liabilities it carries (that is why shareholders' equity is sometimes referred to as 'net assets').

One way to think about this is in business liquidation, if the owners sell all the assets and repay all outstanding liabilities, shareholders' equity is an accounting estimate of what is left for the owners.

Many investors don't spend enough time examining the balance sheet, but it's extremely useful, not least because it enables one to assess the level of a company's indebtedness. Prudent investors avoid companies that are highly leveraged, as a high debt load can cripple a  company and puts equity owners' value at risk.

Cash Flow Statement 

The cash flow statement does not get anywhere near as much attention from analysts and journalists as the income statement, but it is nonetheless vital (remember that a company's intrinsic value is the sum of all future discounted free cashflows, not discounted earnings).

As the name suggests, the cash flow statement is a full accounting of all of the company's sources and uses of cash during the period, and is organized into three sections: Cash flow from operations, cash flow from investing and cash flow from financing.

1779,"First was the dot-com bubble, then the housing bubble. Now comes the commodities bubble. We don't fully understand the stock market's current turmoil, but we do know it's driven at least in part by a bubble of raw material prices. Their collapse weighs on world stock markets through fears of slower economic growth and large financial losses.

All bubbles share similar characteristics. There's a strong, enthusiastic demand for some object (whether stocks, homes, oil or tulips). High demand pushes up prices, which inspires more demand. Prices ultimately reach unsustainable levels so that when spending slows, the bubble implodes. Commodities have now traced this familiar path.

As The Economist reminds, raw material prices respond to different influences. Weather affects crops; technology (aka ""fracking"") affects oil recovery. Still, despite these variations, prices of many commodities — not just oil — have followed roughly similar trajectories in recent years. They have dropped steeply, according to figures from the International Monetary Fund.

Here are declines for five commodities from 2012 through July 2015: oil, down 48 percent; iron ore, 60 percent; copper, 31 percent; palm oil, 39 percent; and wheat, 37 percent. Many commodity prices have continued to fall.

The bubble formed on hopes that China's rapid growth would feed an ever-expanding appetite for raw materials, says economist John Mothersole of the consulting firm IHS Global Insight. Demand and prices would remain high indefinitely. Although prices fell after the 2008-09 financial crisis, China's huge ""stimulus"" package — intended to offset the crisis's drag — sent them up again, says Mothersole. China's demand seemed destined to stay strong, as economic growth would stabilize at a high level.

It didn't. In 2010, China's economy grew 10 percent; the IMF expects 6.8 percent in 2015 and 6.3 percent in 2016. Other economists think growth could be lower. As a result, much of the added production capacity — mines and the like — to supply China isn't needed.

Economies in many emerging-market countries have suffered accordingly. ""In Indonesia, coal once bound for China is piled up in port,"" reports the Wall Street Journal. ""In South Africa, mines that fed China's voracious demand for metals are firing workers."" Stock markets in commodity-exporting nations have also tanked. From last September through Aug. 24, stock prices were down 28 percent in Brazil (exports: iron ore, soybeans, sugar), 21 percent in Indonesia (coal, oil, rubber) and 9 percent in South Africa (gold, coal, iron ore).

What's occurring is a profound shift in the global economy, says economist Hung Tran of the Institute of International Finance. It had been hoped that the rapid growth of emerging-market and developing countries — accounting for about half of global output — would sustain a vibrant world economy. But that hope is fading.

Five years ago, says Tran, the expected gap in economic growth between emerging-market and advanced economies like the United States, Japan and European countries was about 5.5 percentage points. (If advanced economies grew 2 percent annually, emerging-market countries would grow 7.5 percent.) Now the gap is two percentage points or less, he says.

The stock market swoon reflects this larger truth: Future economic growth is being marked down, because the commodity boom artificially (and temporarily) increased past growth. Over-optimism about China caused unneeded investments to be made. It will be harder for commodity exporters to generate jobs for their workers. There are other dangers. The most obvious is that low prices will result in loan defaults or bankruptcies by commodity producers that weaken financial institutions.

The commodities bust has exposed these problems, not solved them. But unlike the dot-com and housing bubbles, whose effects were mostly negative, the commodities bust has a silver lining: Lower prices — especially lower gasoline prices — may strengthen consumer spending. That's one reason many economists don't see an American recession anytime soon. ""The U.S. recovery seems domestically based on housing and consumer spending,"" says economist Tran.

Still, this optimism comes with a caveat. If today's low commodity prices mainly reflect a surplus of production capacity — oil perhaps being an example — the surplus will need to be gradually worked off. But if the low prices also reflect feeble demand, then the economy may be weaker than we thought."
2464,"The department store chain said Friday that its losses narrowed in the second quarter on better-than-expected sales, fueled by men's clothing, fine jewelry and the beauty brand Sephora. And a key revenue measure rose for the third straight quarter.

""Although there is much work to do … it's clear that when we execute well, we can deliver profitable sales and take market share,"" said Marvin Ellison, a former Home Depot executive who took over as CEO on Aug. 1 and presided over his first earnings call for Penney.

The results offer encouraging signs for the Plano, Texas-based retailer, which is more than two years into an effort to recover from a disastrous attempt to reinvent itself under former Apple executive Ron Johnson. That led to massive losses and plummeting sales.

Ellison took over the top job from Myron Ullman, who became executive chairman of the board. Ullman, who had previously run the company, came back as CEO in 2013 after Johnson was pushed out. Ullman helped pick Ellison, and the two executives have been running the company together since last November.

But J.C. Penney still has an uphill road to a full recovery.

Ullman stabilized the business by restoring frequent discounts and bringing back basic merchandise and popular store brands that Johnson eliminated. But sales are still well below where they were before he took over, and the retailer continues to rack up losses, though they're shrinking.

J.C. Penney lost $138 million, or 45 cents per share, for the quarter that ended Aug. 1. That compares with a loss of $172 million, or 56 cents, a year earlier.

Losses, adjusted for one-time gains and costs, were 41 cents per share.

The average estimate of analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for a loss of 50 cents per share.

Revenue at stores opened at least a year rose 4.1%, in line with analysts' estimates.

1957,"A B.C. man who raised $1.4 million from 13 investors over a yearlong period in a Ponzi scheme has agreed to pay back a portion of the money through a BC Securities Commission settlement agreement.

Keith Henry Alexander admitted to the BCSC—the independent provincial government agency responsible for regulating capital markets through the administration of the Securities Act—that he engaged in both the illegal distribution of securities and unregistered trading.

Alexander was an investor in The Little Loan Shoppe, a Ponzi scheme that tricked investors into thinking it was a payday loan business. The Little Loan Shoppe operated through a group of companies controlled by Doris Nelson who used existing investors like Alexander to bring in new clients, paying the existing investors through existing funds they’d brought to the scheme.

The BCSC report detailed that Alexander has agreed to at least pay back a portion of the money he schemed from people.

“Alexander has agreed to pay to the BCSC $7,500 in respect of settlement of this matter, as well as the $20,000 obtained as a result of his misconduct. He is also prohibited from trading in securities (with limited exceptions), and from becoming or acting as a director, officer, promoter, or registrant (with limited exceptions) for a period of three years. Alexander is also banned, for the same period, from acting in a management or consultative capacity in connection with the securities market, and from engaging in investor relations activities.”

Alexander also lost his own personal money that he invested in The Little Loan Shoppe, and has so far returned $143,000 to investors. The BCSC has scheduled a separate hearing for Nelson."
1413,"The price of filling up at the pumps costs £2 less than it did last month, figures have shown.

RAC Fuel Watch has said petrol has fallen by more than 4p a litre to £1.12 as the price of oil plummeted to a six-year low.

The watchdog said 5p had been shaved off the price of diesel, taking the average cost down to £1.10.

Carmarthenshire bus company boss Tom Thomas welcomed the news, saying he was saving £2,890 a month in fuel.

""In March 2014, we bought 8,500 litres and it cost us around £10,370,"" the director of Brodyr Williams Bus Company in Upper Tumble said.

""In July this year we bought the same amount and we paid £7,480 - it makes a big difference.

""It does help us as a company because things were very tough when prices were high... some of the largest buses we have do seven or eight miles to the gallon.""

The fall in pump prices has been driven by a dramatic reduction in the price of oil.

In the run-up to August, oil was at a consistent $60 (£40) a barrel, but dipped below $50 (£33) a barrel at the start of the month and stayed below $50 for the whole month, reaching a low point of $41.87 (£27) on 24 August.

RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: ""We thought July had been a good month for motorists but August proved to be better still due to world oil prices reaching their lowest since February 2009."""

1033,"On the outside, the 250-year-old white farmhouse at Oenoke Ridge and Parade Hill roads in New Canaan appear to be untouched by time.

Its white clapboard siding and dark green shutters were given a fresh coat of paint and a sign that reads “the Ephraim Smith house” still hangs in the front.

A venerable sugar maple serves as the protector of the home, one of New Canaan’s and possibly the state’s oldest maple trees, cared for by the state’s arborist.

While it appears untouched, the classic five-bedroom Colonial has undergone several renovations melding 18th-century charm with 21st-century conveniences.

A 2007 renovation by previous owners helped to successfully merge the historical half of the house with a wing added in the 1950s while adding a professional kitchen, a home office overlooking the family room, a mudroom and a three-car garage.

Inside the 18th-century front entry door, the “parson’s parlor” sits on the left and the “family parlor” sits on the right, both with small fireplaces.

As in any true Colonial home, the property features five fireplaces with three on the first floor and two on the second.

The largest of all five fireplaces is in the keeping room, an earlier version of what’s known today as the family room, because logs were always kept burning in the central fireplace.

The centuries-old hearth still warms the home during colder months, open to the family room, dining room and kitchen, with the original beehive oven perfectly intact for cooking.

An 1800s porch was enclosed to create a sunroom and the original stairway was strategically relocated to the back of the house helping to create a contemporary family wing.

Sourcing floorboards from the sides of a 150-year-old boxcar in Kentucky, previous owners sought to connect the past and present in using these antique wide plank floors throughout the first floor addition.

The professional kitchen was thoughtfully designed in keeping with the period of the home using a honed green granite from Finland closely resembling the look of soapstone but offering more durability.

The kitchen features two islands, the first measuring 4-by-5 feet with a 2-inch thick white Danby marble top used for food prep. The second island is topped with a butternut wood top with a hammered copper vessel sink, ice machine, refrigerator and freezer drawers and a microwave.

A walk-in pantry offers plenty of storage and a second freezer.

Just off the kitchen, a step-down breakfast room with a skylight opens to a family room featuring exposed wooden beams sourced from Canada.

French doors open to a brick terrace with a state-of-the-art winter proof outdoor kitchen that features a Viking professional grill and refrigerator with hot and cold running water.

The property slopes down to the free form Shoreline heated pool surrounded by hydrangeas and stepping stones sourced from the property.

Further, the property opens to a pasture perfect for playing soccer or lacrosse.

The first floor also includes a well organized mudroom with built-in cubbies, a deep walk-in closet and laundry room.

The second floor of the home features two original guest bedrooms, an additional en suite guest bedroom and the master suite.

The third floor features an office, full bath and guest bedroom.

While the 2007 renovation was headed by Rob Sanders, an architect specializing in historical preservation, previous homeowners were responsible for restoring the one-room West School house in 2002.

The historic gem was built around 1784 and moved to its current location in 1811.

Quite possibly one of the oldest original schoolhouses in Connecticut, the building was lovingly restored just over a decade ago and now serves as a playhouse with a powder room.

An original Dutch door opens to a hidden courtyard surrounded by flourishing perennial garden.

Sinotrans Shipping rose as much as 19.9 percent, the most in more than six years, on Friday before narrowing gains to 5.5 percent at 11:04 a.m. Hong Kong time. Sinotrans Ltd. advanced as much as 11 percent.

China Merchants Group and Sinotrans & CSC Holdings Co. will restructure and integrate, shipping-industry website ship.sh reported, citing unidentified people close to the state-asset regulator and from the two companies. The Chinese government is seeking to overhaul state-run companies to introduce more market-oriented reforms to bolster a slowing economy.

The merger and restructuring between China Merchants Group and Sinotrans & CSC is “almost certain,” the ship.sh report said. The two companies had earlier cooperated in setting up a fleet of very large crude carriers, according to the report. China Merchants Group and Beijing-based Sinotrans & CSC couldn’t immediately be reached for comment. China’s markets are closed for two days to mark the 70th anniversary of Japan’s defeat in World War II.

The move comes amid other mooted restructuring among Chinese shipping companies. The government may combine China Shipping Group and Cosco Group or merge some of their operations, people familiar with the matter said Aug. 7. Trading of their subsidiaries, including China Cosco and China Shipping Container Lines, has been suspended, ahead of “major transactions” by their parents.

China Merchants Group has interests in transportation and infrastructure construction, and also controls finance and real estate companies including China Merchants Bank Co. Sinotrans Shipping provides vessel chartering services, while Sinotrans is a logistic unit."

748,"Sao Paulo (AFP) - Rumors that Brazil's finance minister was about to step down Thursday added to growing jitters in the world's seventh-biggest economy, but the real, which has plummeted this year, held steady.

The currency, down more than 29 percent in 2015, closed at 3.760 to the dollar, barely changed, despite the political turmoil.

Finance Minister Joaquim Levy is the face of leftist President Dilma Rousseff's tilt toward austerity reforms, cutting lavish spending that the debt-saddled government can no longer afford.

But his job has become a political lightning rod with Brazil now in recession and the government presenting its first deficit budget this week.

On Thursday, Levy canceled a planned trip of the G20 countries in Turkey and went into a closed-doors meeting with Rousseff, before leaving without comment.

Brazilian media reported that he was believed to be about to step down, but hours later government spokesman Edinho Silva said Levy ""is staying because he was always here. He never left.""

The confusion briefly sent the real diving before recovering and stabilizing.

""The market was very shaken up by the meeting between Levy and the president,"" Alex Agostini, an analyst at Austing Rating, said.

""If the meeting reinforced the minister, the market will be calmed because this would mean backing for the austerity measures."""

1034,"The first real estate project in New York to be financed notably through crowdfunding, AKA United Nations, will open to guests starting Sept. 10, notes a recent story on BloombergBusiness. The extended-stay hotel-condominium on East 46th Street near Second Avenue cost $95 million to purchase and fix up the existing hotel, $12 million of that was gained through online pledges.

Rodrigo Nino, CEO of Prodigy Network, the real estate crowdfunding platform that is gut-renovating the building with partners, said it’s:

He added that until now,

Bloomberg notes that real estate crowdfunding–still a young movement–has fought to establish its credentials in a market where institutional capital abounds, particularly in places as attractive as New York. For perspective, Bloomberg has the numbers:

In other words, real estate crowdfunding may still have a ways to go before it changes the industry as Kickstarter did for creative endeavors. In part, this is because real estate crowdfunding is more complicated. Investors are usually required to be accredited, proving that they can reasonably take risks with their capital, often by showing their tax returns.

At AKA UN, a block and a half west of the General Assembly Building, Prodigy is marketing 95 one-bedroom condos, priced from $1.2 million to $1.5 million. The units — ranging from 562 to 662 square feet (52 to 62 square meters), all with kitchens and most with a balcony — will be rented as extended-stay hotel suites until they find buyers.

 The crowdfunding campaign drew 116 backers, pledging at least $20,000 each. They can expect a return on their investment of 19 percent to 23 percent, mostly from sales of the units and some from hotel fees, according to Prodigy. About 90 percent of the crowdsourced money came from outside the U.S., said Brian Newman, the company’s business-development chief.

One of the advantages that Nino brings to Prodigy is the support of a core of Latin American investors. He began his first crowdfunding campaign in Columbia, his country of birth, in 2010, to construct BD Bacata, the tallest tower in Bogota.

Ben Miller, co-founder of Fundrise.com, notes that Prodigy’s campaign in Manhattan “shows the real estate industry that crowdfunding isn’t just a theoretical model.” Fundraise.com, according to Bloomberg, sold interests in bonds backing 3 World Trade Center in Manhattan for amounts starting at $5,000. Miller said that their effort raised $5 million, though some of the investment banks that originated the bonds were resistant.

So who would live in the condos (all furnished) at AKA United Nations? Buyers across the globe who visit occasionally, and could rent out their investments the rest of the time, Newman said. Note: After the units are sold, crowdfunding investors would no longer receive income from the hotel fees. Also, New York isn’t known for being inexpensive–and prices for these condos adhere to this standard, costing more than comparable housing in the area and requiring higher monthly charges.

Prodigy currently has three more crowdfunding projects in New York. The newest opportunity is The Assemblage/25th Street, “an existing 12-story building located at 114 East 25th Street, at the heart of NoMad in Manhattan.” The minimum investment is $20,000, with an estimated holding period of 3-4 years and a projected IRR of 10-12 percent.

100,"Alabama’s season opener against Wisconsin in Arlington, Texas, is only two days away, so what better way to pass the time than breaking down the three reasons why the Crimson Tide will not win the Southeastern Conference this fall?

Alabama’s defensive front seven is poised for a monster season, as a mixture of experience and depth will cause headaches for opposing offenses in 2015. But the secondary, as a whole, cannot boast that same concoction on the field.

Cyrus Jones is the only experienced cornerback that played at a consistent level last season, while younger players in Marlon Humphrey and Minkah Fitzpatrick have never seen the field in a college game. There is, however, a lot of depth at the cornerback, Star and Money positions, as we’ve seen on the practice field during the teams’ fall camp.

As for the safeties, Geno Smith and Eddie Jackson have little to no familiarity in the backend of the secondary, being former cornerbacks. Behind them, there are only a handful of players at the safety position with true freshman Ronnie Harrison being the No. 3 option.

Mel Tucker will have his hands full trying to improve the defensive backfield’s inaccuracies from a season ago.

As of Thursday, the Crimson Tide’s quarterback competition is still open, with three players – Jacob Coker, Cooper Bateman and Alec Morris – getting the bulk of the work on the practice field. And at this rate, Alabama will likely send two quarterbacks onto the field Saturday.

Offensive coordinator Lane Kiffin is faced with a first-year starter under center for a second consecutive season, but there are plenty of programs across the country that are dealing with that same issue. The thing that makes this quarterback battle a little more difficult is the departure of Amari Cooper.

Cooper was Blake Sims’ security blanket last season, and while the Crimson Tide has plenty of playmakers in Derrick Henry, Kenyan Drake and O.J. Howard, among others, it will still be difficult for Coker, Bateman or Morris to make as smooth a transition as Sims did in 2014. And if the quarterback struggles, it’s hard to imagine this team inside the Georgia Dome in December.

Alabama has one of the toughest schedules in the entire country this season. The Crimson Tide already has to face the vaunted SEC West, but mix in Georgia and Tennessee from the SEC East and Wisconsin in its season opener in two days, and it’s difficult to see an undefeated outcome from that slate of games.

And the month of October is absolutely brutal for Alabama. It faces Georgia on the road, Arkansas at home, Texas A&M on the road and Tennessee at home in back-to-back-to-back-to-back weeks before its lone bye week. Talk about a rough stretch of games.

Oh, and then the team turns around and faces LSU, Mississippi State and Auburn in the month of November. The Crimson Tide’s path to the SEC Championship is arguably the most difficult, making it one reason why Nick Saban and his team possibly misses out on consecutive trips to Atlanta.

1251,"The European Commission has approved under the EU Merger Regulation the acquisition of BG Group by Royal Dutch Shell. The Commission concluded that the takeover would not lead to Shell benefiting from market power in a number of markets, namely oil and gas exploration, the liquefaction of gas and the wholesale supply of liquefied natural gas (LNG). Moreover, the Commission found that Shell would be unable to shut out its competitors from access to its liquefaction facilities that supply LNG into the European Economic Area (EEA) or from gas transportation and processing infrastructure in the North Sea.



The Commission focussed its investigation on the markets where the activities of Shell and BG Group overlap, namely in the exploration for oil and gas reserves, the supply of natural gas and the liquefaction and supply of LNG.



The Commission found that after the transaction the merged entity's market share would remain limited in the exploration for oil and gas reserves, the liquefaction of LNG and the wholesale supply of LNG. Moreover, a number of strong competitors would remain active in these markets after the merger. The Commission concluded that the takeover would not allow Shell to influence prices and that these markets would remain competitive after the transaction, according to the European Commission.



Moreover, the Commission found that Shell and BG Group would be unlikely to prevent competitors from accessing some of Shell's LNG liquefaction facilities used to supply LNG into the EEA or from its natural gas transportation and processing infrastructure in the North Sea. This is mainly because significant additional liquefaction capacity is being built and will come on-stream in the near future, while significant spare oil and gas transport and processing capacity exists in the North Sea region.



The Commission therefore concluded that the transaction would not raise competition concerns.



The transaction was notified to the Commission on 29 July 2015."

Waterloo, Ontario-based BlackBerry pioneered smartphones, but after losing ground to Apple Inc and Samsung electronics Co, the company is shifting its focus to providing software and services for enterprise customers.

Relations between BlackBerry and Good have been tense at times. In January 2015, after Good announced a new system that would make it possible to measure a smartphone user's personal and business data usage, BlackBerry posted a version of Good's release that it had annotated with red ink, questioning its novelty and promoting its own, competing service.

Despite the shortfall, Moody’s described overall job growth as “strong and broad based, except in the energy sector”. Friday will see the much awaited non-farm payrolls number which will be highly scrutinised as the Fed edges ever closer to an interest rate hike.

Germany’s factory orders are up 18% in July from a year earlier due mostly to domestic demand which was up 43% and Eurozone demand which was up 51% for the same period.

China has ramped up controls on yuan exchange conversions which are in place to limit the flow of capital out of the country. These moves by national financial regulators are being interpreted as a clear sign that the surprise devaluation of the yuan last month has triggered an outflow of capital. Manufacturing data released yesterday found that August had the lowest level of activity in 3 years and Goldman Sachs now list the stability of the Yuan and these capital outflows as their biggest risks to the global economy.

The IMF have warned that the economic slowdown in China threatens to push the global economy into difficulty unless the largest economies take action to prevent it. In a meeting of the G20's finance officials the fund stated that ""risks are to the downside and a simultaneous realisation of some of these risks would imply a much weaker outlook"".

GBPPLN closed yesterday’s session at 5.7648.

The Australian GDP reading for Q2 was its lowest quarterly growth rate in 4 years. This was a most likely a result of falling investment in mining and revenue from export industries, both of which have weighed heavily on the economy particularly since its primary trading partner China has started to falter. GBP/AUD currently trades at 2.1843 compared to 1.7618 a year earlier, a full 24% depreciation.

In today’s session all eyes will be on the interest rate decision and policy statement from the European Central Bank.

With a relatively uneventful economic calendar yesterday the market was somewhat muted as traders looked to other global economic factors for volatility. Today will be another session light on UK data.

The pound has seemed broadly weaker in the last fortnight lending cause to the opinion that the UK is not quite ready for a rate hike. Continued depreciation in the Yuan and the extended slowdown in China as a whole has called into question the solidity of the global economy as well as to whether the UK could absorb an interest rate increase.

UK construction PMI was found to have improved in August to 57.3 from 57.1 but fell short of estimates by 0.2. Although this is still a strong level it is worth noting that this index does not influence GDP as much as the manufacturing sector.

498,"HDFC Bank says not interested to enter Ahmedabad International Finance Centre

The Aditya Puri-led bank feels its presence in global IFCs like Dubai, Bahrain and Hong Kong is enough to take care of its overseas business.

MUMBAI: Even as its peers make a beeline to open shop at the GIFT City, the country's second-largest lender HDFC Bank has said it is not keen to have a presence in the country's first international finance centre in Ahmedabad.

""We are not in GIFT City, since we already have our presence in a couple of locations... We are in Hong Kong, Bahrain and the DIFC (Dubai International Finance Centre),"" HDFC Bank deputy managing director Paresh Sukthankar told PTI.

A presence in specially notified international finance centres help financial institutions treat it as an overseas branch, from where they can raise resources at cheaper rates and lend in foreign currencies.

The regulators issue separate regulations for operations of such financial hubs.

Banks that have evinced interest to have a presence in GIFT City, including the largest lender SBI and Bank of Baroda, already have a sizeable presence abroad and are adding to their networks.

Other lenders from the private sector space which have made their plans public and are at different stages of entering the GIFT City include Kotak Mahindra Bank, Yes Bank and Federal Bank.

HDFC Bank's larger rival ICICI Bank and Axis Bank (both of whom have registered offices in Gujarat) have not commented on their plans.

The GIFT City was formally launched as the country's first international finance centre in April this year."
479,"While some gaming analysts predict the devaluation of the renminbi may hit the city’s mass gross gaming revenue, the city’s monetary authority says that in the long view Macau’s positioning as a centre of world tourism and leisure ‘remains intact’, as it’s focusing on diversification in industry structure and visitor sources.

 Following the recent announcement by the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) on further improvement in the renminbi (RMB) exchange-rate mechanism to promote the RMB internationalisation and market-driven rate, the exchange rate of the RMB against the USD weakened in the past few days.

 Under the current exchange rate regime of the SAR, the exchange rate of the pataca against the RMB has strengthened correspondingly.

 Following its preliminary assessment, the Macau Monterey Authority (AMCM) released a statement last night confirming the short-term effect, but vowing that the city is prepared for the long term and still expects a positive return for the entire year of 2015 for the fiscal reserves.

Local economy

 AMCM says the RMB devaluation would undermine export competitiveness in the short term but would not affect the long-term and diversification developments of local industries.

 It went on to say that as tourism is the dominant sector of the economy and the Mainland is the top visitor-generating source for the SAR - accounting for over half of the SAR’s visitor arrivals - the weakening of the RMB might reduce the attractiveness of the SAR as a tourism destination for Mainland visitors. Tourism and retail businesses are expected to be adversely affected in the short term.

 AMCM claims that the current devaluation is still mild, however, compared to the revaluation in the past few years. ‘The SAR’s development towards a Centre of World Tourism and Leisure through diversifications in industry structure and visitor sources remains intact,’ the statement reads.

Inflation easing

 AMCM expects the yuan’s devaluation to result in import prices further lowering, leading to moderate inflationary pressure. Local inflation has receded in tandem with economic consolidation.

 In the first half of 2015, CPI inflation slowed to 4.92 per cent from 6.05 per cent in 2014. The import unit value index, which reflects imported prices, declined by 1.4 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter of 2015.

 As most of the foodstuffs in the SAR are imported from the Mainland, the weakening of the RMB would further lower imported prices and alleviate the cost-of-living pressure for residents.

Positive return

 Regarding the influence on the city’s fiscal reserves, AMCM says short-term returns will be adversely affected while appropriate risk-control measures have been taken.

 At end-June 2015, after the adjustment of currency swap positions, the share of RMB assets in total Fiscal Reserve assets was 33.0 per cent, compared to 48.6 per cent at end-2014. As of June 2015, the annualised rate of return on the Fiscal Reserve was preliminarily estimated at about 4.0 per cent. It is expected that the fall in the exchange rate of the RMB against the USD would lower the annualised rate of return for the first eight months of 2015.

 “The performance for the whole year will depend upon the global financial-market development in the remaining months while a positive return for the entire year of 2015 is expected,” the statement reads.

 AMCM also stresses that under the investment strategy to control the risks strictly, RMB assets held by the Fiscal Reserve will help enhance medium-to-long-term returns."
2037,"The jury in a long-running Serious Fraud Office (SFO) case found Vicki Ravana Letele guilty of 10 charges, under Section 228 of the Crimes Act, of dishonestly using a document.

Letele faced 11 charges, relating to 11 property transactions that took place in 2010, but the jury found her not guilty on one charge.

The SFO case detailed how Letele and an associate, Ramni Kumar, used fake documents to get mortgage finance for low income families who wouldn’t otherwise have been able to get finance.

The mortgages were then used to buy property from interests related to Letele and Kumar, which generated them a profit which, ultimately, amounted to $3.9 million.

SFO director Julie Read said vulnerable investors are often targeted by those who are aware of their inexperience in dealing with significant financial transactions.

“We hope the verdict demonstrates that serious financial crime in the lending environment will be discovered and prosecuted.”

 

 She added that it is important, wherever possible, to get advice from reputable advisers and institutions.

At the time of the offending, Letele was the sole director and shareholder of Focus Property Investment Ltd, which was established to broker mortgages for first home buyers on low incomes.

In 2011 she resigned her directorship of Focus and the company was placed into liquidation in 2012.

However, this case was not the first time Letele has been in trouble with the law.

In 2013, she was convicted and sentenced for practicing as an unlicensed real estate agent.

 

 Letele has been remanded on bail and will be sentenced on 3 November.

Kumar pleaded guilty to the charges laid against her earlier this year and was sentenced to 12 months on home detention and 250 hours of community work.

179,"August’s jobs report will be big news, but the data should be taken with a grain of salt. By  Andrew Soergel Sept. 3, 2015 | 6:00 a.m. EDT

Analysts are on pins and needles this week in anticipation of the most significant employment report published in years – a release that could ultimately empower or impede a September interest rate decision from the U.S. Federal Reserve.

But the data's accuracy isn't necessarily guaranteed. A quick glance through the Labor Department's revision history shows that initial August employment estimates almost always undershoot how well the labor market is actually performing.

[READ: Where Are All the Workers?]

""If you look over the last 10 years or so, August tends to have the most significant miss on the downside of any month,"" says Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors. ""And, then, ironically, over the course of the subsequent two months, the miss gets revised away. In many cases, the month ends up being stronger than what was originally reported. But for some reason, disproportionately, there tends to be a big miss on the flash [report].""

Take last year, for example. The labor market in August 2014 was originally reported to have added only 142,000 new positions. That's a relatively soft number and well below the 200,000-job threshold to which many analysts have become accustomed.

Fast-forward two months. Through a series of revisions, the Labor Department finally concluded that 203,000 positions had been added to the labor market in August 2014. That's a 61,000-position difference.

It was the same story in 2013. The Labor Department originally reported 169,000 additions in the month of August. This was later revised up to 238,000, a 69,000-job jump.

August employment numbers have been revised up in 17 of the last 20 years and in every year since the U.S. exited the Great Recession. Since 2009, the Labor Department's initial August report has short sold labor market gains by more than 440,000 positions.

""Maybe it's the way they're calculating teachers returning to school, or high school or college students leaving their summer jobs, or some residual problem with the auto industry going on furlough because they're retooling machines, or something quirky,"" Orlando says, noting that August 2014's initial report was 88,000 jobs shy of analysts' expectations. ""The miss isn't always of that magnitude, but there's almost always a miss.""

Data revisions are normal, but the sheer size of the August adjustments is not. The difference between the initial and final job growth estimates in the month of August is consistently higher than almost every other month.

Since 2009, the number of August jobs added in final revisions each year has averaged more than 74,000. The difference has been greater than 100,000 jobs on three separate occasions since 2003. Only September and November can say the same.

""This jobs number on Friday is probably going to be the last really huge number the Fed gets on which to base its decision. And let's just say that, hypothetically, this report whiffs by 50,000,"" Orlando says. ""We can sit there and say that we've studied this over the last 10 years and the flash print tends to be bad but we tend to revise it up. You and I can intellectualize that. But how is the Fed supposed to base a decision to hike interest rates for the first time in nine years on a 50,000[-job] miss?""

But the Fed can't base an interest rate decision on a series of revisions that may or may not pan out. In 2008, the Labor Department's initial August estimate was 43,000 positions stronger than its final revision. And the August 2005 report was 21,000 positions too strong. Though August misses on the downside more often than not, the Fed can't realistically go all-in on a positive revision.

Complicating matters is the fact that Fed officials can't seem to agree on how well the U.S. economy is performing. Narayana Kocherlakota, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, described policy normalization in an interview at an international economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, last week as ""definitely premature,"" while Loretta Mester, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, said ""the U.S. economy could support a modest increase in interest rates.""

Only a small group of regional bank presidents will vote on interest rates at the Federal Open Market Committee's meeting on Sept. 16 and 17 in Washington, but it's clear that not everyone's on the same page, which makes August's jobs report all the more important.

""Many committee members appear increasingly impatient to raise rates, but an equally large number of policymakers appear unconvinced that the best course of action is to raise rates at this time with so much uncertainty in the balance,"" Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Fixed Income, wrote in a research note Monday.

Without a strong headline employment number Friday, the Fed has little justification for a rate hike. But if history repeats itself Friday, the Labor Department will publish weaker-than-expected data, and the Fed will have an even more difficult decision on its hands. August's statistical anomaly could ultimately tip the scales away from a rate hike.

""[In the event of a weak report], they probably push that thing back to the December 2015 meeting, because that gives them the ability to see the October and November jobs reports. And it also buys you a couple more months to see if the inflation data gets any better and if the market stabilizes and if China starts to get some traction,"" Orlando says. ""If December rolls around and we still don't have the things the Fed feels it needs to have, of course you can roll into March 2016. No one has a gun to the Fed's head saying they need to move now.""

798,"Cycling hotspot and fitness trendsetter SoulCycle has been hit with a proposed class-action lawsuit recently, stating that the brand “robs customers” by forcing them to buy certificates to pay for each class that expires within “unreasonably short” periods of time.

This lawsuit is coming at a crucial time for the company, after having just announced an initial public offering, hoping to sell public shares in a moment when the company is on the upswing. However, this obstacle is only adding to the previous doubts many have had about SoulCycle’s IPO. According to Fortune, it’s always risky investing in a fitness company, because exercising trends are constantly changing. Add a lawsuit on top of that, and the offer may be even less appealing.

The case has been filed by California customer Rachel Cody, who accuses the company of a “relentless effort to maximize profits,” by charging customers $30 for a certificate that can be used for a future class. But with short expiration dates, says Cody, her certificate expired before she was able to use it.

Of course, SoulCycle gives you the option of buying certificates in more pricey packages, and those certificates have more lengthy expiration dates. But for those who have purchased one certificate at a time, they often have no choice but to take the loss.

Cody is not the only one finding these certificates problematic. With SoulCycle’s increasing popularity, many complain that securing a bike during peak times becomes very difficult. The more difficult it is to get into a class, the less likely you are to use your certificate, making wasted money a not-so rare occurrence.

Cody is also accusing SoulCycle’s certificate expiration date of violating the Credit Card Accountability and Disclosure Act, which states that businesses are required to “establish fair and transparent practices relating to the extension of credit under an open end consumer credit plan.”

The potential lawsuit states that by calling these class vouchers “certificates” means they must follow the rules of gift certificates, which, according to this law, are not allowed to have expiration dates shorter than five years.

According to Business Insider, customers are also taking to Yelp to complain about this company policy. One New York City customer wrote, “If you pre-purchase a single class or a series of classes, they will expire (single class expires within 30 days, series of five within 45 days). At $30 a class, I feel like there should be more of a notice before the classes expire, since we're all busy people who have to juggle various deadlines.”

The lawsuit’s aim is to refund all customers who have lost money from certificates that expired before they could use them. Business Insider also said that SoulCycle declined to comment on the suit in an effort to maintain the quiet period before their IPO. As for the $100 million they hope to raise in their upcoming IPO, time can only tell if this lawsuit will hinder growth of the new cult-like fad."
1057,"If you’re buying or selling a house in the District or Montgomery County after Oct. 1, you’ll be working under a new sales contract.

For as long as I can remember, when writing contracts for the purchase of residential real estate, we used what is known as the Regional Sales Contract. It was a boilerplate document that required an addendum to comply with the laws and customs of the various jurisdictions.

So, in the District, you included the Jurisdictional Disclosure and Addendum for Washington. In Northern Virginia, you used a similar form.

As of January of this year, however, the Northern Virginia Association of Realtors opted to use its own residential sales contract. That prompted the Greater Capital Area Association of Realtors (GCAAR) to review its forms and to create a contract that would work better for agents and consumers in Montgomery County and the District, which make up GCAAR’s jurisdiction.

The new form, the GCAAR sales contract, “has eliminated the redundancy found in prior versions, shortened the length of the Jurisdictional Addenda . . . to improve the agent and customer experience,” according to the group’s training instructions.

Those who object to the voluminous amounts of paper used in real estate transactions will be pleased to learn that when the new forms are used, there will be eight fewer pages in Montgomery County and up to four fewer pages in the District.

There are a number of technical changes in the new forms. For instance, the words “Date of Contract” at the beginning of the form are changed to “Date of Offer.” This is intended to avoid confusion as to when a contract is ratified. That date is highlighted at the end of the contract, just above where the parties sign their names.

Here are some other significant changes:

?The words “Time is of the essence” are moved from the end of the old contract to the very top of the GCAAR contract. This provides an important reminder that when a number of days are specified for certain actions to be taken, those deadlines are carved in stone and if you miss a deadline, you may be out of luck. For instance, if you have five days to have a home inspection and you don’t get it done or get the deadline extended by mutual consent, you lose the contingency.

? The new form does not use dollars except for the final price; instead it includes percentages for the down payment and financing. This is intended to take into account price negotiations that often continue between buyers and sellers and that alter the amounts of the down payment and financing. “Now the parties can simply negotiate the sales price and not have to constantly change the dollar amounts for the other sections,” according to GCAAR. “ It makes the contract cleaner and more legible.”

? Since termites are not the only vermin that can affect real estate, the heading “Termite Inspection” is changed to “Wood Destroying Insect Inspection.” The old form allowed either seller or buyer to pick up the cost of such an inspection; the new form refers only to the buyer — unless the buyer will be obtaining a VA loan.

? Even when there is a fully ratified contract, the new form gives buyers the unilateral option to void the contract and have their deposit refunded until they have received all of the required forms and information related to lead-based paint. In addition, a misconception about ratification has been corrected. Previously, it was thought that if a buyer had not acknowledged receipt of forms related to lead-based paint (for properties built before 1978), the contract could not be ratified. GCAAR — based on its research — concluded that a contract “is ratified without these forms” when the parties sign all of the contract documents.

An important change can be found in the Addendum of Clauses. The old form was a six- page document containing 24 miscellaneous clauses such as Seller Credits and Post Settlement Air Conditioning and/or Swimming Pool Inspection Contingencies. In my experience, potential buyers had to wade through all of the clauses, and at most, they generally checked off only two or three.

Now, the Addendum of Clauses will be separated into two parts, A and B. GCAAR says the reason for this change “was to put the contingencies most used in one and those less frequently in the other.”

For example, part A includes Seller’s Credits to Buyer, Home Inspection and Appraisal Contingencies and Post Settlement Occupancy Addendum. Part B contains all the other issues that were contained in the one large document.

Your real estate broker or agent should become familiar with the new forms. GCAAR is holding training sessions between now and Oct. 1.

Regardless of which form you use, here’s an important suggestion: Do not leave any blanks in the contract. If there is something not applicable, just write in “N/A” or even draw a line through the blank. This will keep anyone from adding fraudulent language to the contact after it has been ratified.

2157,"Frivolous patent litigations has continued to financially hurt countless companies across the country who often feel the need to settle to avoid litigation costs. Wouldn’t it be nice if companies could turn their resources back towards positive innovation, benefiting the economy, and have low quality patents removed from the system?

Fortunately, with the new Patexia Coalition Funding Initiative, Patexia will bring companies together who are facing expensive patent litigation to fund and file an IPR to eliminate the threat. Through participation in the coalition, companies facing litigation using low quality patents will have an alternative to settling to avoid high litigation costs, and can put their resources back towards innovating.

Founded in 2010 to open the way for innovation by improving patent quality through crowdsourcing, Patexia is an online platform that connects clients to a community of more than 10,000 global subject matter experts who help them better assess, manage and monetize their IP portfolios. By offering more reliable IP research through crowdsourcing, Patexia promotes efficiency and drives innovation.

Bill Shreve and the Glaukos success story: When having an IP attorney pays off

In line with Patexia’s mission to open the way for innovation by eliminating low quality patents, Patexia has launched a new initiative designed to let companies get back to innovating rather than devoting resources to fighting frivolous patent litigation. In the IP industry, bad actors routinely file patent suits simultaneously targeting a large group of companies using the same patent.  In many cases, these actors use low quality patents to try to force defendants to settle rather than face a lengthy and expensive litigation process.

According to Patexia, the new coalition funding initiative provides an efficient solution. Patexia monitors new patent litigation across industries and when a frivolous case is filed, Patexia immediately reaches out to the targeted companies to bring them together and form a defense coalition.

Then, using proven crowdsourced patent analysis techniques with a 75 percent success rate based on client feedback, Patexia searches for prior art and partners with experienced legal counsel to take the case to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board for an inter-partes review, in an effort to eliminate the threat.

“Through Patexia’s coalition funding initiative, companies share the burdens they would otherwise face alone,” the company stated.

Companies participating in a Patexia coalition contribute as little as $50,000 for a crowdsourced prior art search and the IPR. Going it alone, to fight patent litigation through IPR a company must pay $27,000 in PTAB filing fees alone (not including the attorney and expert fees). Oftentimes, total litigation costs can spike into the millions.

Patexia defense coalition allows participants to find support in fighting back against frivolous lawsuits and no longer need to feel the need to settle to avoid litigation costs. Now, companies can turn their resources back towards positive innovation, benefiting the economy."

2326,"Zhu Chenhui, a Chinese online celebrity also known as Cherie, has made headlines after reports that she is expected to make more than 150 million yuan ($23.57 million) this year from her online clothing store based on Taobao.



The figure has been emphasized as being more than what Fan Bingbing makes.



Zhu was born in Zhejiang Province in 1990, and moved to New Zealand in 2011 to study at the University of Auckland. Toward the end of 2014, she opened a Taobao clothing store.



Taobao is an online marketplace operated by the Alibaba Group that allows sellers to post goods for sale.



Zhu has also become known for her relationship with Wang Sicong. Wang is the son of Wang Jianlin, the Wanda Group tycoon.



According to data from Taobao, Zhu's store had 873,331 deals as of July, with each deal grossing between 220-240 yuan ($35-$38), totaling more than 200 million yuan ($31.4 million) in revenue.



Sources from Taobao claim that the average profit margin for a clothing store is 45 percent. It is estimated that Zhu could make a net profit of 150 million yuan ($23.6 million) before next year.



Currently, there are around 1,000 online stores on Taobao that sell women's clothing. These stores usually earn revenue of over 1 million yuan ($157,000).



Online celebrities who sell on Taobao often leverage their popularity and the support of their followers to get sales.



The news of Zhu earning more than the Chinese actress is made more relevant because of recent news that Fan is the fourth-highest paid actress in the world, earning about $21 million over the past year, according to Forbes. Fan is the only Chinese actress on the list.

Local media put the sudden return of volatility down to Chinese brokerages increasing margin lending and short-selling. Traders and analysts in Europe and the U.S., meanwhile, spoke of concerns over another devaluation of the yuan, fuelling another rout in its stock market.



""We think there is a reason to believe that the Chinese renminbi (yuan) devaluation isn't over. There could be more moves there,"" Ben Gutteridge, the head of fund research at Brewin Dolphin, told CNBC Tuesday."
1767,"With oil prices surging after the global market turmoil of ""Black Monday,"" could investors regain their faith in commodities?

One economist told CNBC Thursday that if China fired enough stimulus into its economy, a longer-term bounce back in commodities could be on the horizon.



""We certainly think that the authorities in China have the firepower in terms of monetary and fiscal policy to enact enough stimulus for the economy to at least meet the growth rate they're targeting,"" Caroline Bain, senior commodities economist at Capital Economics, told CNBC on Thursday.

Brent and WTI crude oil prices surged as much as 9 percent on Thursday, following a rally in equity markets, an unexpected fall in U.S. crude inventories and U.S. second-quarter GDP data that was stronger than the previous estimate. 



Markets were also boosted on the news, reported by China's state media agency, that Beijing had expanded its debt-for-bond swap program. This is aimed at easing the financing pressure on China's indebted local governments and comes as part of a series of moves by Beijing to boost its national economy and stabilize its stock market."
1135,"A plan to create a mega £1.7bn housing association in Merseyside by merging two existing associations has stalled.

In February the ECHO reported that Liverpool Mutual Homes (LMH) Group and Symphony Housing Group, who between them own and manage 46,000 homes, were in merger talks.

However, it has now emerged that those discussions have ground to a halt and LMH has said it is now open to other “merger opportunities”.

Symphony will concentrate its focus, reinforced by the summer 2015 Budget, upon continuing with its internal partnership review and changes to the current operating arrangements within the group.

Both organisations will continue during this period to look for opportunities short of merger to work more closely, in order to help with improving value for money and delivering more and better outcomes.

Steve Coffey, chief executive of LMH, said: “There is a clear need for consolidation in the sector and to become more efficient and increase value for money following the summer 2015 Budget.

“LMH is committed to embrace this agenda and use our strong position together with our simple, and integrated, operating model to achieve better outcomes following this shift in policy.

“We have a well developed set of design principles which clearly define the simple and efficient way our organisation is run.

“We remain keen to pursue this opportunity with Symphony once their internal partnership review has achieved its objectives but in the meantime we will look at other suitable opportunities.”

The chief executive of Symphony Housing Group, Phil Gandy, said “The exploratory work we did with LMH was extremely useful, but at this point Symphony has decided to focus upon completing the streamlining process within our existing operating structure before considering further expansion of that structure.

“This leaves the option open to revisit the opportunity with LMH at a later date.”"
2118,"The Iowa Fertilizer Company and Orascom E&C USA have agreed to pay a $80,689 civil penalty to settle alleged violations of the Clean Water Act associated with the construction of a new fertilizer plant in Wever, Iowa, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Region 7 announced.

Orascom is Iowa Fertilizer's construction contractor for the site and is jointly responsible for compliance under a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit with the Iowa Department of Natural Resources. EPA Region 7 inspected the facility in June 2014 to evaluate the site’s compliance with its stormwater permit. Of the 369-acre site, construction-related activity had occurred on nearly 323 acres.

The EPA inspector identified violations at the site, including the failure to install or implement adequate stormwater control measures, failure to update or amend the Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP), and failure to perform adequate stormwater self-inspections.  EPA observed that the violations resulted in sediment-laden stormwater leaving the site and entering a tributary of the Mississippi River.

Construction projects have a high potential for environmental harm as they disturb large areas of land and significantly increase the potential for erosion. The Clean Water Act requires construction sites to have controls in place to limit pollution from being discharged via stormwater into nearby waterways. Without proper onsite pollution controls, stormwater runoff can carry pollutants into waterways and degrade water quality, threatening aquatic life and its habitat, and impair the use and enjoyment of waterways.

 

The Clean Water Act seeks to protect streams and wetlands that form the foundation of the nation’s water resources. Protecting streams and wetlands is also part of adapting to climate change impacts like drought, sea level rise, stronger storms, and warmer temperatures.

Following EPA's inspection, the companies took actions to address the violations observed during the inspection and to return the site to compliance with the Clean Water Act. The proposed settlement is subject to a 40-day public comment period before it becomes final. Information on how to submit comments is available at the following link:"

2516,"We're learning more about the events leading up to the departure of former BVU Chief Executive Officer Wes Rosenbalm's departure.



Rosenbalm pleaded guilty in July to conspiring to defraud the Internal Revenue Service and conspiring to solicit or demanding services from businesses while receiving federal money. We obtained a report Monday from Brown Edwards accounting firm that was addressed to the BVU board for September 16, 2013. This is significant because we know Rosenbalm's severance package was granted on September 25 of that year less than a week later.



Here's a look at what that report found. It consists of nine items they list as items ""concerning policy and other noncompliance detected in relation to the actions of the president of BVU.""



Those include using purchasing procedures and internal controls to buy $2,000 worth of camera equipment. It also includes submission of an invoice with no BVU business purpose, which described goods sold to Tri-Cities Christian School. It shows that Rosenbalm used his position as president of BVU to acquire gifts from vendors. It includes the use of the same position to request vendors of BVU to provide services and materials to Tri-Cities Christian School at no charge. It includes security services provided by BVU vendors at Rosenbalm's home over several years at no charge.



The report also showed the hiring of a public relations consultant for Tri-Cities Christian School retained by BVU for no business purpose. Rosenbalm also used BVU employees for personal assistance at his residence during BVU business hours. It showed he also had unauthorized personal use of BVU vehicles. The report included improper record-keeping noting ""comp-time"" instead of accrued vacation.



A lot of this information was presented in the factual statement to the courts, one Rosenbalm signed off on. What is important is now we're seeing the audits the company did prior to Rosenbalm leaving the company. At the BVU Financial Committee Meeting Monday, members discussed past BVU donations to Tri-Cities Christian School and seeing if the company can retrieve any of the more than $16,000 donated to the school since 2004. We reached out to the school. Their board chairperson told us they are meeting with legal counsel about the situation.

2299,"Companies had to delay their earnings briefings on Friday as the ASX's reporting platform was hit with a technical fault.

But companies have been reporting delays before their results appear on the ASX website since August 21.

Cabcharge last Friday had to begin its earnings presentation at 9.30am with analysts who were not there in person unable to see the results until about five minutes in. However, the company said this is not unusual and its annual general meeting results in 2014 were delayed for longer.

On Tuesday, Healthscope's results could only be seen on the ASX site just a few minutes before it began its presentation at 10.30am.

Normally, reports are on the ASX site well before briefings to give time to digest the detail.

However, the ASX disputed these reports. It said Cabcharge's results were available at 9.06am and Healthscope's at 9.39am, well before their investor briefings.

On Friday, Monash IVF had to delay its 10.30am briefing as its results were delayed by more than an hour.

It was told by the ASX that there was a ""technical problem"" with its online eLodgement platform.

""[This] prevented some companies including Monash IVF from making lodgements today,"" a spokesman for the company said.

""The ASX advise that they do not know when the announcements will release to the market, with some unavailable in time for investor briefings.""

He said Monash could not recall there being such a long delay before.

A spokesman for the ASX said delays are commonplace towards the end of profits season as many companies crowd into the last few days of August.

""Due to the large number of company announcements for end of financial year reporting, there are minor delays to the release of some company announcements,"" he said.

""The stocks of companies that have lodged their financial reports with ASX  – but which are not yet released - are placed in a 'pre-open' trading pause to ensure the market remains informed. This is standard practice.""?"

888,"The dollar rose on Wednesday as fragile global stock markets stabilized, taking the heat out of a rush to unwind carry trades that have boosted the safe-haven yen and the low-yielding euro in the past few weeks.

A spike in risk aversion due to slowing Chinese and global growth prompted investors to cut unfavorable bets in the yen and the euro, both of which have been popular funding currencies for carry trades. Such trades involve selling low-yielding currencies to buy riskier, higher-yielding assets.

The dollar was up 0.6 percent at 120 yen, rising from a low of 119.225 yen as a sense of calm returned to equity markets with U.S. stock futures pointing to gains on Wall Street. The yen had jumped about 1.6 percent on Tuesday when global stocks, including Wall Street, fell sharply.

""U.S. payrolls will be the focus, but I doubt it will change the current debate over whether the Federal Reserve will hike rates in the near term or not.""

On Wednesday, investors will comb the employment report as a rough predictor of the more comprehensive U.S. non-farm payrolls due on Friday. Analysts said only if the jobs report shows a huge jump in average earnings will investors start to price in a good chance of a Fed hike in September.

247,"CHARLESTON, W.Va. — The struggling coal industry is rearing its head in state revenue collections with coal severance revenue already down $20 million from estimates after just two months of the fiscal year.

The state Department of Revenue released the latest numbers Thursday. The state collected $299 million in taxes in August, which was $7.5 million below estimates. Shortfalls in July and August have put the state $12.3 million below where it thought it would be. It’s due to the continued downturn in the coal industry, state revenue Secretary Bob Kiss said.

“There may be some good news in the area of personal income tax (collections) but at the end of the day we are continuing to run behind the set estimates each month which if that continues for several more months it will put us at the same situation as the last couple of years,” Kiss said.

Severance tax receipts are down 37 percent from last year at this time, the revenue department said. Coal exports are down 70 percent from just a few years ago.

The state is looking for some bright spots, Deputy Revenue Secretary Mark Muchow said.

“We will have some good news coming up in a couple weeks when the Procter & Gamble groundbreaking takes place (in Martinsburg). There is some activity beyond the minerals, but the severance industry is definitely hurting,” he said.

There are currently no new plans to cut spending in state government, Kiss said.

“We are continuing to look at it and monitoring it but right now, other than the hiring freeze which is place, we are currently not looking at or designing anything,” he said."
2140,"On August 6, OFAC announced a $271,815 settlement with a New York-based insurance company with an overall focus on marine insurance and related lines of business, professional liability insurance, and commercial umbrella and primary and excess casualty businesses. According to OFAC, from May 8, 2008 to April 1, 2011, the company and its London branch office, “issued global protection and indemnity (“P&I”) insurance policies that provided coverage to North Korean-flagged vessels and covered incidents that occurred in or involved Iran, Sudan, or Cuba—some of which led to the payment of claims.” The company’s willingness to engage with OFAC-sanctioned countries resulted in 48 alleged violations of Foreign Assets Control Regulations, Executive Order 13466 of June 26, 2008, North Korea Sanctions Regulations, Iranian Transactions and Sanctions Regulations, Sudanese Sanctions Regulations, and Cuban Asset Control Regulations. OFAC stated that (i) the company did not maintain a formal compliance program at the time it issued the P&I insurance policies; and (ii) the company’s London office personnel “misinterpreted the applicability of OFAC sanctions regulations.” The final settlement amount reflects the fact that managers and supervisors knew or had reason to know that the majority of the insurance policies and claims payments at issue involved OFAC-sanctioned countries; the company is a commercially sophisticated financial institution; and it did not have a formal OFAC compliance program in place at the time the apparent violations occurred. Mitigating factors included the company’s cooperation with OFAC’s investigation; lack of prior enforcement action; and its remedial action plan to implement a sufficient OFAC compliance program."
764,"Millennials are the hottest topic of the moment, especially when it comes to marketers, who never seem to tire of millennial talk. They are slicing and dicing everything related to this generation -- from what they like and what they don’t, to their growth in the workplace and their future impact on the economy. In short, everything that will help them attract this lucrative group. But being obsessed with capturing the millennial mind share, are today’s marketers turning a blind eye to more obvious truths of generational marketing? Let’s take a closer look at where marketers may be going wrong while targeting Gen Y.

It makes no sense for any brand to focus on only one generation, unless it sells products meant solely for that particular age group. For instance, a brand selling walking sticks will probably do ok if they choose to target only the elderly -- although, it’s safe to assume that many of their purchases are made by their boomer offspring! But, let’s say, you sell eco-friendly products. The millennials’ much-known proclivity towards sustainability issues and positive brand images may have you believing they are your prospective buyers. And, while a recent study found that 63 percent of millennials prefer eco-friendly product packaging, more than half of both Gen-Xers and baby boomers have the same preference. You can imagine the cost of targeting only millennials and ignoring the rest.

Related: Everything You Know About Millennials Is Wrong

The biggest problem in targeting only millennials is you risk alienating buyers who don’t fall within that age bracket. And let’s not forget, as your millennial clientele age, they will be more attracted to brands that serve older generations, which you have missed the boat on because you failed to catch their eye as they were growing up.

While millennials are a huge generation, much like the boomers, there may be a bit too much emphasis on them as a whole and not enough sub-context around the vast difference between older millennials and younger millennials. The same holds true when discussing gender roles. Most of the brand messages and ads targeting millennial consumers are male-centric, overlooking the Gen-Y women—an emerging financial force.

Therefore, if a brand targets millennials, a marketer’s best chance for success will be through smart segmentation.

With so much more data and information about millennials at our fingertips, are we turning too much attention to them? My answer is: yes and no. Here’s why.

Many brands are smitten by statistics gushing about millennials’ big buying power. However, to conclude that they possess the most spending dollars is a near-sighted approach. I’d like to put it this way. Young adults may be buying more now because most of them have just stepped into new jobs or are still at an early stage of financial stability. With marriage and children will come expenses, such as daycare costs, school fees, mortgages or rent and other necessities. This will cause their spending power to decline over time.  So, it’s safe to assume millennial-centric marketing might set you up for failure in the long run.

At the same time, we can’t ignore the fact that millennials are a challenging market. They take to technology like a fish to water. It sometimes feels like their first words have a hashtag attached and smartphones are an extra appendage. When marketing to millennials, what has worked for past generations doesn’t work for them. This is why brands need to adapt and adopt a different set of strategies to attract them.

Rather than targeting any specific age group, I think it’s more important to understand the next generation of business leaders and investors. So while there is too much hype around millennials and brands need to cut through it, it’s also very important for marketers to understand the behaviors, shopping patterns and work habits of this generation, as well as where they will be in a decade or two. The key lies in using that information to segment and power the proper type of marketing to each millennial category, rather than lumping them all of them into one big group, or, even worse, ignoring them altogether."
1546,"With near-record production, prices for sweet Bakken crude oil continue to tumble, according to the latest report from the North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources (DMR) released Friday. However, officials said current production levels cannot be sustained at the price points reached early this month below $30/bbl.

Month-long oil and natural gas numbers were down slightly in June -- the most recent month for complete statistics -- while the daily totals were a second-best ever for oil and a new high for natural gas, according to Lynn Helms, DMR director and the state's chief oil/gas regulator. Helms added that the state now is gearing up for a period of low oil prices that could last up to two more years, but he thinks the capacity is present to sustain current production levels.

In June, oil production hit 36.3 million bbls (1.21 million b/d), compared to 37.2 million bbl (1.20 million b/d) in May, while natural gas production for the month was 49.5 Bcf (1.65 Bcf/d), compared to 50.5 Bcf (1.63 Bcf/d) during the previous month.

""There is real cause for concern with North Dakota sweet crude hitting $28.50/bbl today,"" Helms said. ""Those kinds of production numbers can't last at those price points, so either we have to see some better prices, or see some further contraction in terms of oil/gas activity.”

Currently, the crude oil prices are running 12% below August forecasts for Bakken crude, Helms said. ""So it is doubtful that production is going to be able to make up all of the forecast revenue,"" he said.

Helms said his department's assessment shows that North Dakota is not alone in seeing production levels maintained despite large drops in prices. He cited the Eagle Ford Shale and Permian Basin as two areas similar to the Bakken's experience so far, judging from the continuing large inventory of uncompleted wells. The Eagle Ford's inventory is about twice that of the Bakken, and the Permian is on par with the Bakken, according to Helms.

""U.S. oil/gas producers are not indicating any decreases in U.S. oil production,"" Helms said, adding that as prices have dropped ""they have found ways to cut costs and be a lot more efficient with their drilling and completions. It seems that for relatively little capital investment, operators are able to maintain production.""

In response to a question during a webinar, Helms said lifting the U.S. ban on crude oil exports, could add $8-10/bbl to the price of U.S. crude. He called that a potential ""game changer"" for the Bakken.

Helms said DMR's model for forecasting production indicated that 1.2 million b/d of production could be sustained for two years at the 848 uncompleted well level and with the state's current depressed rig count. ""Even though we have the low prices, there is not a drop in production, which was what OPEC was trying to achieve,"" he said. ""It would appear now that OPEC's efforts are geared more toward Russia and Iran.

Unconventional wells in the Bakken passed the 10,000 level in June and now 79% of the wells in the Bakken-Three Forks formations are unconventional, Helms said, adding that uncompleted well totals dropped to 848, down substantially from end-of-May numbers. ""Companies were very aggressive in completing wells,"" he said. The rig count has stayed relatively stable, settling in at 74 today, following a July average count of 73, totals of 78 and 83 in June and May, respectively."
1058,"Commercial real estate does not have the same bond to social media that other industries have. Some professionals use social media platforms well to raise their profile, share vital information and ultimately expose their listings, while others see it as a waste of time.

As with all technology, social media is always evolving and the next iteration of social media arrived, but could it be a tool for the industry or just a waste of time?

The newest trend in social media is called Periscope. It is an app that allows users to broadcast video from their outward-facing camera on their phone. Those watching the video can interact by sending messages that appear on-screen. The video stays online for only 24 hours.

Since Twitter acquired Periscope in March, more than 11 million users are using the app. Many prominent CEOs are using it to share leadership and business thoughts or to give a small peek into their operations and daily routines. Most social media experts believe Periscope is on the forefront of a new wave of social media platforms that take interactivity to a new level.

For commercial real estate professionals, there are some potential benefits to using Periscope that could add value to their business.

One way would be to take a page from the CEOs currently using the app to share their knowledge of the market. Perhaps an apartment broker could schedule just five minutes a week to use Periscope to share with his followers what trends they are seeing in the marketplace or discuss current issues such as changes in interest rates or cap rates. They could also interact with their audience by taking questions or offering advice. It could be a great way to attract new clients, as well as increase their visibility on both a local and national scale.

Another idea for industry professionals would be to use Periscope to film property tours. A broker could literally take people from all over the world on a real-time tour of a listing and even answer questions on the spot.

Periscope may not be for everyone, but for those wanting to stay ahead of the social media curve, it may be worth experimenting with.

1349,"CALGARY, AB, Sep 03, 2015 (Marketwired via COMTEX) -- NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION OR FOR DISSEMINATION IN THE UNITED STATES

Parex Resources Inc. (""Parex"" or the ""Company"") (PXT), a company focused on Colombian oil exploration and production, is pleased to announce three new Colombian oil discoveries on blocks LLA-26 and LLA-34, and increased oil production guidance for 2015.

All amounts herein are in United States dollars (""USD"") unless otherwise stated.

Rumba/Bazar (Operated, Block LLA-26, WI 100%): Parex spud the Bazar-2 exploration well on July 28, 2015 to test the Mirador and Une formations on a separate structural closure along the same fault trend as the recent Rumba discovery. The bottom hole coordinates of the well are approximately 2.2 kilometers northeast of the Rumba-1 discovery well and 1.1 kilometers northeast of the Rumba-2 appraisal well. Bazar-2 reached the Mirador Formation target depth on August 23, 2015 and encountered potential oil bearing zones with electric log characteristics and hydrocarbon shows suggesting oil pay. The Bazar-2 well appears to share the same oil water contact in the Mirador Formation as the Rumba discovery suggesting the Mirador pool is continuous along the fault from Rumba-1 to Bazar-2. The well is currently drilling ahead to final target depth to test the deeper potential in the Une Formation. The well is expected to be tested later in September.

Chachalaca (Non-Operated, Block LLA-34, WI 55%): The Chachalaca-1 well was the first well to be drilled on an untested fault trend located northwest of the Tigana fault trend and was drilled to a depth of 12,270 ft. The well encountered three potential oil zones in the Mirador Formation. The initial test of the Chachalaca-1 well in the upper Mirador was only 63 hours in duration as an Electric Submersible Pump failure necessitated a workover on the well. During the initial 63 hour test, a total of 2,743 barrels of 31 API oil was recovered for an average production rate of 1,045 barrels of oil per day (""bopd""). The measured water cut from the zone at the end of the test period was 6% with some workover fluid yet to be recovered. Failure in the ESP sensor did not allow the producing bottom hole pressure to be estimated but this information will be obtained during the final well test. Testing of the well has now resumed and will continue for the allowed 7 day test period. The well also encountered potential oil pay in the Guadalupe Formation but it tested wet.

Jacana (Non-Operated, Block LLA-34, WI 55%): The Jacana-1 well was drilled to a depth of 10,900 ft along the same fault trend as the Tigana field approximately 6 kilometers southwest of the southernmost Tigana well. The well encountered potential oil bearing zones in the Mirador and Guadalupe formations and was tested in the deeper Guadalupe Formation. After 151 hours of a short term test a total of 10,746 barrels of 14.9 API oil was recovered for an average rate of 1,710 bopd. At the end of the test the well was producing at approximately 1,900 bopd which represents the limit of the current test facilities. After recovery of workover fluids the water cut dropped to 0.4% and subsurface pressure recorders measuring the producing pressure indicate a drawdown of approximately 18%. Testing the Jacana-1 well has been terminated and the drilling rig will be skidded to drill the Jacana-2 appraisal well which is to be located approximately 800 meters northeast of Jacana 1 towards the Tigana pool. Parex expects that the Jacana-1 well will be placed on long term production test in the Guadalupe Formation after drilling the Jacana-2 well. The Mirador Formation is expected to be tested in future Jacana appraisal wells.

Following the Jacana-1 oil discovery, the presence of oil in the Mirador and Guadalupe formations has now been confirmed along the entire fault trend a distance of approximately 15 kilometers from Tilo-1 to Jacana-1. The interpreted oil column height at Jacana-1 in the Guadalupe Formation is in excess of the mapped structural closure which suggests that the discovery may potentially extend beyond the southern end of the fault and is trapped stratigraphically to the south of Jacana-1.

Tilo (Non Operated, Block LLA-34, WI 55%): The Tilo-2 delineation well was drilled 740 meters southwest of the Tilo-1 well to delineate the Guadalupe reservoir. The Tilo discovery is located along the same fault trend as Tigana with the Tilo-2 well bottom hole coordinates approximately 3.5 kilometers from the Tigana Norte well. The well has been cased and encountered potential oil pay in the Guadalupe Formation. The drilling rig is being mobilized off of the location after which a completion rig will be mobilized to test the Tilo-2 well later in the year.

Guepardo (Operated, Block LLA-32, WI 70%): Guepardo-1 well was drilled and encountered good quality sands in the Mirador and Guadalupe formations but were both interpreted to be water bearing. The well was abandoned without testing. Further exploration drilling on LLA-32 had been planned for 2015 but has been deferred to 2016 in light of the exploration drilling success on blocks LLA-26 and LLA-34 and allocating additional capital to those areas.

Parex forecasts 2015 production to be approximately 27,400 bopd as compared to the original 2015 oil production guidance of 26,500 bopd. The revised production forecast represents an increase of 22% compared to the 2014 annual average oil production of 22,526 bopd. Fourth quarter 2015 oil production is forecast to be 28,500 bopd, an increase of 7% from production of 26,544 bopd for the fourth quarter of 2014.

Capital expenditures for 2015 are estimated to now range between $140-$145 million dependent upon oil prices as Parex will continue to review its discretionary exploration capital programs in the context of our funds flow from operations given the lower oil price environment.

Parex plans to drill the Taringa-1 and Tautaco-1 wells back to back to increase drilling rig efficiencies and accordingly does not expect to commence drilling the Taringa-1 well until surface negotiations are complete for the Tautaco prospect on block LLA-10, which is anticipated to be late 2015. Accordingly for the remainder of 2015 capital expenditures will likely be limited to drilling the Jacana-2 appraisal well on LLA-34, commencement of drilling the Taringa-1 exploration well, Tautaco prospect civil construction and finishing facilities work on LLA-34, Rumba and LLA-32.

Parex is committed and able to maintain its strong balance sheet and cash reserves notwithstanding the lower oil price environment. At June 30, 2015 Parex had drawn no bank debt on its USD $200 million syndicated credit facility and had working capital of approximately USD $90 million including approximately USD $104 million of cash.

Funds flow from operations is a non-GAAP term that includes all cash generated from operating activities and is calculated before changes in non-cash working capital. Management uses funds from (used in) operations to analyze operating performance and monitor financial leverage, and considers funds from (used in) operations to be a key measure as it demonstrates the Company's ability to generate cash necessary to fund future capital investments. Funds flow from operations is reconciled with net (loss) income in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

2128,"The lawsuit filed by Arthur J. Gallagher against the former CEO of its international brokerage operation, David Ross, who defected to Towergate earlier in the year – has been settled for a payment of £20 million ($30.9 million).

Gallagher filed the suit in March 2015 in the High Court after Ross, who had led its international division for 10 years, announced in February that he was leaving the broker to take up the post of chief executive officer for rival Towergate, even though he had a year-long non-compete agreement.

Shortly thereafter, a group of his former colleagues also left Gallagher to join Towergate, including (in alphabetical order) Adrian Brown, Sarah Dalgarno, Janice Deakin and Mark Mugge.

Brown, who was former executive chairman of underwriting and distribution at Gallagher, will become Towergate’s chief operating officer. Dalgarno, former chief risk officer at Gallagher, will take on the same position at Towergate. Deakin, who was CEO of UK retail at Gallagher, is the new retail broking director at Towergate. Mugge, who was CFO at Arthur J. Gallagher International, is now Towergate’s CFO.

Along with Ross, Mugge was named in the Gallagher suit, as was Christopher Keey, a consultant, but not a Gallagher employee.

As part of the settlement, Towergate has agreed to pay £4 million ($6.2 million) in August 2015 and £4 million in April 2016 for cessation of all litigation proceedings. The remaining £12 million ($18.5 million) of the settlement will be paid by majority owners, Highbridge Capital Management in two £6 million ($9.3 million) segments in August 2015 and April 2016.

Highbridge is the alternative investments arm of JPMorgan, which, along with other creditors, took over Towergate in February to restructure its £1 billion ($1.5 billion) debt burden.

As a result of the settlement, Gallagher agreed to the early release from his contract of Ross, who will join the firm on November 1, 2015 as chief executive officer, subject to regulatory approval, while Brown will join the firm on September 14.

“We are pleased that the High Court proceedings initiated in March 2015 between Arthur J Gallagher, David Ross and others have been settled, enabling Towergate to focus its full attention on successfully growing its business,” said a statement from Towergate, adding that “a prolonged period of uncertainty for the firm has been averted.”

Scott Egan, interim chief executive officer, will leave Towergate on September 14 to become group chief financial officer of RSA Insurance Group plc, at which time Adrian Brown become interim CEO* for a six-week period until Ross joins the company, when Brown will take up the position of chief operating officer, Towergate said in a statement.

The broker said its leadership team has been strengthened over the past few months by the arrival of Janice Deakin as retail broking director, Mark Mugge, as chief financial officer, while Sarah Dalgarno joins as chief risk officer* on September 4.

“I am very pleased that a settlement has been agreed between a number of incoming executives and Gallagher, bringing much needed clarity to the management of the Towergate business,” said Chairman John Tiner.

“With all of these appointments alongside our existing leaders we will have an outstanding executive team, whom I am confident will lead the business to sustained success in the future,” he added.

29,"May 3 (Bloomberg) -- The European Central Bank joined the international rescue of Greece, saying it would indefinitely accept the country’s debt as collateral regardless of its credit rating, underpinning gains in the bond market.

The decision came less than a day after Greece agreed to a 110 billion-euro ($145 billion) package of emergency loans from the International Monetary Fund and its euro-region allies. Under the plan backed by the ECB, Greece pledged 30 billion euros in budget cuts to bring a deficit of 13.6 percent of gross domestic product within the EU limit of 3 percent in 2014.

“The ECB is a key player in the rescue package designed to help Greece and it is clearly buying insurance against the likelihood of further multiple downgrades of the Greek debt, something that might lead to a halt of ECB financing to the Greek banks,” said Silvio Peruzzo, an economist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in London.

Further downgrades from credit-rating companies had threatened to render Greek bonds ineligible for collateral for ECB loans after Standard & Poor’s last week cut the nation to junk status. Had Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings followed suit, Greece’s debt would have no longer been accepted under the previous rules, threatening to inflict further pain on the economy and its banks.

The yield on Greece’s benchmark 2 year bond fell 183 basis points today to 11.74 percent, after reaching almost 23 percent on April 28 on rising concern about a possible Greek default. The premium investors demand to hold Greek 10-year bonds over comparable German debt fell 50 basis points today to 5.44 percent.

The ECB’s Governing Council said Greece’s commitment to the terms of the bailout was “appropriate,” the Frankfurt-based bank said in an e-mailed statement. “This positive assessment and the strong commitment of the Greek government to fully implement the program are the basis, also from a risk management perspective, for this suspension.”

Today’s decision was a reversal for ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet, who began the year saying the ECB would not change its “collateral policy for the sake of any particular country.”

That prompted Christoph Rieger, co-head of fixed-income strategy at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt, to say today’s announcement “leaves a sour taste with regards to the ECB’s long-term credibility.”

Governing Council member Ewald Nowotny said as recently as April 30 that the central bank’s monetary policy “in no way is influenced by the developments in Greece.” Nowotny also echoed colleagues in calling S&P’s move “very unhappy and problematic timing.”

Greek banks hold about 45 billion euros of government bonds, about 10 percent of their total assets, according to an April 30 report by Capital Economics Ltd. Greek bank shares have slumped this year as the country’s bonds tumbled on concern about a possible default. The Greek bank-share index has fallen more than 26 percent, almost twice the decline in the country’s benchmark ASE Index.

“For the banking sector it’s a big relief,” said Frederik Ducrozet, an economist at Credit Agricole SA in Paris. “It’ll support the liquidity situation and Greek banks will still be able to come to the ECB with their country’s sovereign debt, European banks will be able to too.”

In October 2008, the ECB cut the minimum rating for all the government debt it accepts as security for lending to BBB-, the lowest investment grade, from A-. It extended the policy change indefinitely on April 8 this year as it became clear a return to the old rules may exclude Greece.

S&P cut Greece on April 27 to BB+, one notch below BBB-, its lowest investment grade rating. Moody’s said April 29 that it may impose a “multi-notch” downgrade from Greece’s current A3 rating. It said it would make a decision after the government announced the budget steps agreed on with the IMF and EU.

The ECB decision “removes the risk of a liquidity crisis in the euro zone due to rating downgrades, said Luca Mezzomo, head of macroeconomic fixed-income research at Intesa Sanpaolo SpA in Milan. ‘‘Greek banks refinance about 12 percent of their assets at the ECB, a situation that in the future will have to be corrected, but certainly not during the implementation of an emergency plan of support.’’

ECB Governing Council member Athanasios Orphanides said today the bank has not discussed loosening its lending rules for nations other than Greece. The council convenes in three days in Lisbon, an apt location as Portugal has also suffered downgrades and pressure from investors on its government to regain control of public finances.

If Greece’s woes do spill over into other economies and markets, the ECB may need to take other steps to stem the contagion and protect its economy from a return to recession or even splintering, said David Owen, chief European economist at Jeffries Group Inc. in London.

Among its options would be widening today’s new collateral arrangement to other members, reviving unlimited loans to banks for up to a year and even buying bonds, he said. While the ECB is prohibited from buying assets directly from authorities, it can do so on the secondary market.

‘‘There may be a need for more radical measures from the ECB,” said Owen. “Today isn’t the end of the story.”

530,"From a market crash to cyber attacks, Denver is vulnerable to a drop in its economic output from human and natural disasters of as much as $10.6 billion over the next decade.

That’s according to a report from Lloyd’s of London, the world-famous the specialty-insurance market, called ""Lloyd's City Risk Index 2015-2025."" ( Click here to access it.)

The idea of the study is that when a catastrophic event, such as an earthquake, a pandemic or a financial crisis, hits a city, it reduces its gross domestic product, or GDP, and Lloyd's has attempted to calculate that potential loss for major cities around the world, including Denver and 34 others in North America.

The Lloyd's report, released Thursday, said Denver’s greatest threat is a market crash, which posses a $3.28 billion threat; followed by oil price shock, a $2.06 billion threat; and a cyber attack, which would be a $1.84 billion threat to the state.

There are more vulnerable cities. New York and Los Angeles top the Lloyd’s City Risk Index chart with $90 billion in potential GDP losses.

Those cities are vulnerable to market crashes, too. But in Los Angeles, risk stems from natural threats including earthquakes that could be potential output loss of $18 billion and floods with a potential loss of $13 billion.

The risk factors and hefty potential losses are based on research by the Cambridge Centre for Risk Studies at the University of Cambridge Judge Business School.



The City Risk Index explored the potential impact of 18 catastrophic threats, both individually and collectively, on the GDP of 301 major cities around the world. It used the metric, ""GDP@Risk,"" to quantify the potential losses from one or more threats to a location’s projected 10-year economic output.

The figure is calculated by taking into account the severity of each potential threat, a city’s economic profile and its vulnerability to each threat and ability to access capital for recovery, the report says.

Across North America, the potential output losses from man-made and natural threats for 35 major cities over the next decade could total $616.9 billion.

“The Lloyd’s City Risk Index highlights the significant risk to GDP posed by man-made and natural threats in the major cities and regions of North America,"" said Hank Watkins, president, Lloyd’s North America. ""As the risk landscape evolves, the (re)insurance industry’s role in assessing and assuming risk will remain a vital component of risk mitigation and resiliency."" The City Risk Index is designed to stimulate the conversation between business, government and (re)insurers on our collective responsibility to ensure that appropriate steps are taken to promote awareness of risk and facilitate post-event recovery, Watkins said."

790,"Cortendo has followed through on its long-gestating plan to list on Nasdaq. The Swedish-American biotech is pitching to raise $86 million (€76 million) to pump into a pair of late-phase trial programs, the more advanced of which could lead to a regulatory submission in the back half of 2017.

When combined with the $54.4 million it had in the bank as of the end of June, Cortendo thinks the IPO haul will give it enough cash to advance its two lead candidates toward approval. The near-term success of Cortendo rests on COR-003, a treatment for endogenous Cushing's syndrome that is due to deliver Phase III data in the first half of 2017. If all goes according to plan, Cortendo will include the data in the aforementioned regulatory filing that is penciled in for later that year. COR-003 is a single enantiomer of ketoconazole, a now off-patent drug physicians have used off-label to treat Cushing's.

Cortendo plans to advance COR-003 along the 505(b)(2) regulatory approval pathway, allowing it to reference FDA's historic take on the safety and efficacy of ketoconazole to support its case. The idea has proved compelling enough to help Cortendo persuade investors to part with their cash. An $11 million bridge financing landed in Cortendo's bank account in October, three months after which it pocketed a further $27.5 million. Investors chipped in another $33.2 million in May to support the acquisition of a pair of Phase II acromegaly treatments.

The buyouts gave Cortendo the makings of an orphan drug portfolio, something that is central to CEO Matthew Pauls' attempts to pitch the company to IPO investors as a U.S.-focused rare disease specialist. A slice of the anticipated IPO windfall will go toward advancing one of the recently acquired assets into late-phase trials. The R&D program for COR-004, the new name for the drug Cortendo picked up from Australia's Antisense Therapeutics for $5 million, is due to receive a post-IPO cash injection. Depending on what regulators have to say, Cortendo will push the drug into either Phase II or III.

Cortendo paid far more for its other acromegaly drug, now known as COR-005, but it is somewhat further from bothering regulators. The asset, which Cortendo paid $30 million for, is due to enter a dose-ranging study in the wake of the IPO.

2298,"NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Gap  (GPS - Get Report) is scheduled to release its 2015 second quarter financial results after the market close on Thursday afternoon. Analysts are expecting that the company will post a year over year decline in earnings.

The company has already reported net sales of $3.90 billion for the most recent quarter, which fell short of analysts' estimates for revenue of $3.97 billion.

Gap also reported net sales of $1.12 billion for July 2015, down 3% from the same period a year ago.

Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters have forecast that the company will report second quarter earnings of 64 cents per share on revenue of $3.97 billion.

Last year Gap reported earnings of 75 cents per diluted share on net sales of $3.98 billion for the 2014 second quarter.

Gap, based in San Francisco, Calif., is an apparel retail company that owns the Gap, Banana Republic and Old Navy brands.

Separately, TheStreet Ratings team rates GAP INC as a Buy with a ratings score of B. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation:

""We rate GAP INC (GPS) a BUY. This is driven by several positive factors, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures, notable return on equity, reasonable valuation levels and expanding profit margins. We feel its strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had sub par growth in net income.""

1927,"Local Business Owner Indicted in Alleged Ponzi Scheme A total of four face charges of mail fraud and wire fraud after an alleged scheme to rob investors out of nearly $3 million.

A Skokie man who owns Devon Street Investments Ltd. is one of four individuals charged with wire fraud and mail fraud in a 14-count indictment that resulted from an alleged Ponzi-scheme that involved selling $2.9 million in phony mortgages to investors.

Albert Rossini, 67 was charged with 11 counts of wire fraud and three counts of mail fraud in the indictment that was filed last week and unsealed Tuesday, according to the United States Attorney’s Office Northern District of Illinois. Rossini is accused of conspiring with Babajan Khoshabe, 74 of Chicago and Khoshabe’s son, Anthony Khoshabe, 33 of Skokie to fraudulently induce at least 15 victims into purchasing purported mortgage notes on apartment buildings in foreclosure, according to the indictment.

“The trio promised that investors would receive rental income from occupants of the buildings, followed by title to the properties at the conclusion of the foreclosure process,” the indictment states.

But the three did not own the mortgage notes and used the victims’ funds to make Ponzi-type payments to other investors and pocket the rest. The scheme is alleged to have begun in 2011.

Babajan Khoshabe was charged with eight counts of wire fraud and three counts of mail fraud, his son with five counts of wire fraud and three counts of mail fraud.

“Rossini and Babajan Khoshabe allegedly told prospective investors that Anthony Khoshabe managed the mortgaged properties through his position at Reliant Management, which shared office space with Devon Street Investments,” according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office. “Anthony Khoshabe would purportedly collect monthly rents from the buildings’ occupants and turn them over to investors. What the defendants failed to reveal is that Reliant Management did not manage the properties, and Anthony Khoshabe had no legal ability to collect the rents, the indictment states. The periodic payments made to investors were actually derived from funds that other investors had pledged into the scheme.”

Thomas Murphy, 61, an Illinois Attorney who is alleged to have “claimed to validate the sale of the mortgage notes through a phony “Guaranty Agreement,”” was also indicted.

The wire and mail fraud counts carry a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, plus mandatory restitution."
2083,"Fraudsters send fake text messages in the hope that victims will ring and give personal details

Con artists are sinking to new lows to steal personal or financial information by sending the messages that claim there has been fraud on the recipient's account or the account details need to be updated, according to Financial Fraud Action UK (FFA UK).



The alarming texts encourage people to call a number or visit a website, often as a matter of urgency. 



But the phone number or website is actually controlled by a criminal, enabling them to fool customers into handing over security details that can be used to access the victim's bank account and steal money.



To make the texts seem authentic, the fraudsters use specialist software , that alters the sender ID on a message so that it appears with the name of a bank as the sender. 



As fraudsters go to greater length to steal money, it means the text is included in an existing message thread on the recipient's phone.



The scam texts may advise that the recipient will receive a call from their bank's fraud department - and the crook then calls the victim and attempts to trick them into revealing their full security details.



Intelligence also suggests that fraudsters are sending scam texts that appear to be from a landline number, asking the recipient simply to call their bank. 



This is in the hope that the victim will phone the number from which the text was sent, which is controlled by the fraudster, rather than the bank's regular customer service telephone number.



To avoid becoming a victim of this scam, people should be suspicious if a text message asks them to provide sensitive personal information, passwords or to make transactions.



If a consumer is asked to call a number given in the text message and the number is unknown to them or appears suspect, they should call their bank on a number that they trust - such as the one on the back of their card - in order to check that the number and message are authentic.



FFA UK said people should remember that their bank will never phone them to ask for their four-digit card Pin or their online banking password, even by tapping them into the telephone keypad.



Banks will not ask people to update their personal details by following a link in a text message or ask them to transfer money to a new account for fraud reasons, even if they say it is in the consumer's name.



Katy Worobec, director of FFA UK, said: ""These text messages can look very authentic, so it's important to be alert. Always be wary if you receive a message out of the blue asking you for any personal or financial details.



""If you're ever at all suspicious, call your bank on a number that you know. Remember, fraudsters are after your security details - don't reveal anything unless you are absolutely sure who you are dealing with."""
486,"How Has the Devaluation of the Yuan Impacted Global Markets? (Part 1 of 6)

The Chinese yuan devaluation has been the major driver of the massive volatility in the foreign exchange markets over the last two weeks. Asian currencies have been negatively impacted the most due to the perceived risk of an impending currency war. Economies could compete against each other to have the upper hand in elevating export volumes and price value.

Falling commodity prices amid sluggish growth expectations in the Chinese economy have had a spiraling effect on Latin American currencies as well. A devalued yuan will have negative consequences on China’s imports, many of which are sourced from major South American countries. Crude prices have also been adversely impacted due to slow growth coupled with higher cost of crude imports for the Chinese economy.

Middle East countries are thus under pressure resulting from the developments. The US dollar index has been affected unfavorably by the yuan devaluation, which goes against the ongoing talk towards hiking the US benchmark interest rates. Developed countries thus have benefited in terms of their currencies with respect to the US dollar, the exception being commodity currencies like the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar, which depreciated against the US dollar.

The volatility for major currency pairs between the close of August 7 and August 21 has varied across economies depending on geography, domestic capabilities, and trade dependence on China. Leading the top gainers was the Swedish krona with an increase of 4.71% on a cumulative basis. The Swedish krona, which is an integral member of the basket of currencies comprising the US dollar index, was helped further by positive comments by the government regarding increased growth estimates.

The euro and the Swiss franc have been riding high, owing to the recent fall in the US dollar index, which inherently constitutes the aforementioned currencies. On the other hand, exhibiting a significant tumble, the Kazakhstani tenge fell by more than a quarter of its value in view of the fact that the central bank moved towards a free-float regime from maintaining a currency peg. The fall in crude prices among other commodities caused the downfall in the Russian ruble, the Malaysian ringgit, and Latin American currencies.

Among global ETFs between the close of August 7 and August 21, the iShares MSCI World ETF (URTH) fell by 6.60%. Also, the WisdomTree Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Bullish Fund (USDU), which encompasses not only developed economies but also emerging market currencies, dropped by 1.11%.

American depository receipts (or ADRs) trading across the globe between August 7 and August 21 ended on a negative note. BHP Billiton (BHP) plummeted by 10.24% during the period, while oil major Exxon Mobil (XOM) fell by 6.11%. Sony (SNE) dropped by 8.64%."
157,"1. At the Monetary Policy Meeting held today, the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan 8301 -0.11 % decided, by an 8-1 majority vote, to set the following guideline for money market operations for the intermeeting period: [Note 1]

The Bank of Japan will conduct money market operations so that the monetary base will increase at an annual pace of about 80 trillion yen.

2. With regard to the asset purchases, the Bank decided, by an 8-1 majority vote, to continue with the following guidelines: [Note 1]

a) The Bank will purchase Japanese government bonds (JGBs) so that their amount outstanding will increase at an annual pace of about 80 trillion yen. With a view to encouraging a decline in interest rates across the entire yield curve, the Bank will conduct purchases in a flexible manner in accordance with financial market conditions. The average remaining maturity of the Bank’s JGB purchases will be about 7-10 years.

b) The Bank will purchase exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real-estate investment trusts (J-REITs) so that their amounts outstanding will increase at annual paces of about 3 trillion yen and about 90 billion yen respectively.

c) As for CP and corporate bonds, the Bank will maintain their amounts outstanding at about 2.2 trillion yen and about 3.2 trillion yen respectively.

3. Japan’s economy has continued to recover moderately. Overseas economies—mainly advanced economies—have been recovering, albeit with a lackluster performance still seen in part. In this situation, exports and industrial production have been picking up, albeit with some fluctuations. Business fixed investment has been on a moderate increasing trend as corporate profits have improved. Against the background of steady improvement in the employment and income situation, private consumption has been resilient and housing investment has been picking up. Meanwhile, public investment has entered a moderate declining trend, although it remains at a high level. Financial conditions are accommodative.

On the price front, the year-on-year rate of increase in the consumer-price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) is about 0 percent. Inflation expectations appear to be rising on the whole from a somewhat longer-term perspective.

4. With regard to the outlook, Japan’s economy is expected to continue recovering moderately. The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI is likely to be about 0 percent for the time being, due to the effects of the decline in energy prices.

5. Risks to the outlook include developments in the emerging and commodity-exporting economies, the prospects regarding the debt problem and the momentum of economic activity and prices in Europe, and the pace of recovery in the U.S. economy.

6. Quantitative and qualitative monetary easing (QQE) has been exerting its intended effects, and the Bank will continue with QQE, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will examine both upside and downside risks to economic activity and prices, and make adjustments as appropriate. [Note 2]

Kiuchi proposed that the Bank will conduct money market operations and asset purchases so that the monetary base and the amount outstanding of its JGB holdings will increase at an annual pace of about 45 trillion yen, respectively. The proposal was defeated by a majority vote.

[Note 2] Mr. T. Kiuchi proposed that the Bank will, with the aim to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent in the medium to long term, continue with asset purchases and a virtually zero interest rate policy as long as each of these policy measures is deemed appropriate under flexible policy conduct based on the examination from the two perspectives of the monetary policy framework. The proposal was defeated by an 8-1 majority vote. Voting for the proposal: Mr. T. Kiuchi. Voting against the proposal: Mr. H. Kuroda, Mr. K. Iwata, Mr. H. Nakaso, Ms. S. Shirai, Mr. K.

2173,"Southfield, MI (Law Firm Newswire) September 2, 2015 - Elizabeth Karnicki was killed when her head was run over by a duck boat in Chinatown in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Her horrified husband watched, unable to assist her.

The Karnicki family allege there was negligence involved in her death and have filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the City of Philadelphia, the parent companies of the tourist operation that ran the duck boat tours and the builder of the boat.

Karnicki, 68, was apparently crossing the street at Arch and 11th streets on May 8 when the duck boat hit her, crushing her head and body.

The wrongful death lawsuit filed by her family alleges she was legally crossing the street at the time of the accident, but due to several large blind spots common with vehicles the size of a duck boat, the operator performing two roles at once as driver and tour guide and a badly set up traffic signal, Karnicki was struck and killed. It also stated that she had the right of way when entering the crosswalk, but that the light changed while she was still crossing.

According to eyewitnesses, however, Karnicki was using her iPad while she was crossing the street during a red light when the duck boat had the prevailing green light, a fact the boat company reiterated in a statement issued after the accident. Witnesses told police that Karnicki walked out onto the street while distracted with her mobile device and that the duck boat driver was not at fault. Ultimately, the police concluded the Ride the Ducks boat was not at fault.

Although the duck boats are large, featuring a 2.5-ton chassis, and the driver sits 10 feet from the bow, which may cause blind spots, they are considered to be relatively safe.

“It is unclear how this case will be resolved based on the two different versions of the story, but Mr. Karnicki may be interested in knowing that in order to alleviate any financial difficulties he and the family are experiencing as a result of Karnicki’s death, securing a lawsuit loan is an option open for his consideration,” said Daren Monroe, a Michigan-based Litigation Funding Corporation representative.

Applying for pre-settlement funding may be done online or by calling Litigation Funding Corporation directly and speaking to a highly trained representative. Plaintiffs are required to have an attorney representing them and have the proper paperwork regarding the case filed when they make an application for a lawsuit loan.

It usually takes less than 48 hours once an application has been approved for the pre-settlement funding to arrive in the plaintiff’s bank account. From there, they may take care of all of their urgent expenses, such as funeral and burial costs and keep current with their other usual monthly bills. Having a lawsuit loan in the bank means being able to start the healing process while moving toward a settlement or having a case heard in court.

613,"Asian stocks fell ahead of the monthly U.S. jobs report, with the regional gauge on course for a seventh week of losses as energy and consumer shares slumped.

The MSCI Asia Pacific Index declined 1 percent to 124.87 as of 4:06 p.m. in Hong Kong. The gauge has slumped 4.8 percent this week, on course for its longest streak of weekly losses in four years. The measure is down more than 20 percent from its seven-year high in April.

U.S. shares on Thursday pared gains in afternoon trading in New York as optimism about European central bank stimulus gave way to anxiety over Friday’s jobs report and its implications on Federal Reserve interest-rate policy.

“The next few months are likely to remain rough for shares,” said Shane Oliver, Sydney-based global strategist at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which oversees about $109 billion. “Worries about China and the Fed are likely to linger for a while. It’s still too early to be confident we have seen the low.”

The payrolls report on Friday represents the last major data point before the Fed meets to discuss the first increase in interest rates in nearly a decade. U.S. data on Thursday showed jobless claims rose more than forecast last week, while a measure of the services industry hovered just below a 10-year high.

Futures traders are betting the Fed will push back raising its fed funds rate. The probability of an increase in September has fallen to 30 percent, from 38 percent at the end of last week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

605,"Broncos' 53-man roster to be selected by Saturday

Thursday's game against the Cardinals is the last in the Broncos' preseason.

GAMETRACKER: Live updates and analysis from the Broncos-Cardinals preseason game

And for 22 players, it could be their last in Denver.

With Saturday's deadline to trim the roster to 53 looming, the final preseason game on the docket also is the final chance many will have to prove their worth.

The starters will sit out this one, and many were on the field before kickoff to get in a workout. The full list of starters and veterans sitting: Emmanuel Sanders, Peyton Manning. Aqib Talib, C.J. Anderson, Ronnie Hillman, Chris Harris, Darian Stewart, Bradley Roby, Omar Bolden, T.J. Ward, Brandon Marshall, Lerentee McCray, Von Miller, Danny Trevathan, Matt Paradis, Ryan Harris, Evan Mathis, Ty Sambrailo, Owen Daniels, Virgil Green, Demaryius Thomas, Antonio Smith, Sly Williams, DeMarcus Ware, Derek Wolfe and Malik Jackson.

With the regulars out, the repetitions will be divvied up among the backups.

WATCH: What would it mean if Trevor Siemian performs better than Brock Osweiler?

Brock Osweiler, who enters the final year on his contract, will cap his impressive training camp with a start Thursday. He and Trevor Siemian, a seventh-round pick from Northwestern, will play a half apiece, coach Gary Kubiak said, enough time to give the Broncos' coaches a long look at their reinforcements at quarterback.

Two of the biggest positional battles, however, are with their receivers and rushers.

Montee Ball, once the Broncos' starting running back, and Kapri Bibbs will share the bulk of the snaps against the Cardinals. Ball is fighting for a spot on the roster after slipping from No. 2 on the depth chart when camp opened.

""They both deserve plenty of touches and they should get them coming out of this game, and they will both play special teams a great deal, too,"" Kubiak said Tuesday. ""We talked about the Montee deal. He needs a bunch of carries and he'll get them on Thursday.""

Demaryius Thomas, Emmanuel Sanders and Cody Latimer have the top three receiver jobs locked up, meaning the last two or three (or four) jobs are up for grabs. Backup receivers Jordan Norwood, Andre Caldwell, Bennie Fowler, Corbin Louks, Isaiah Burse and Jordan Taylor will see time out wide, in the slot and in special teams, too, on Thursday.

Kubiak and special teams coach Joe DeCamillis are searching for receivers who can also help on kickoffs and punts.

""It's huge,"" Kubiak said of special teams. We could be a five, six, seven receiver football team depending on how things play out here over the weekend. It's very big.""

For nearly two dozen players, preseason game No. 4 has, perhaps, the most meaning. It could mean the loss of a job or a dream realized.

""Hopefully we come out of it healthy and then we can make our decisions,"" Kubiak said. ""Hopefully we've got about three or four guys that play in a way that make us say, 'You know what? I'm not sure this is right.' Obviously, you've formed an opinion up to this point, and I know every year it seems like you come out of this game changing your mind about a couple players. It's up to them. I'm looking forward to watching the young guys play.""

National Anthem: Gabe Gibbs, of the musical ""The Book of Mormon""

Peyton Manning's 77-yard touchdown pass to Demaryius Thomas was nullified because of Julius Thomas' chop block on Calais Campbell that Cardinals coach Bruce Arians called the ""dirtiest play in (his) 37 years"" in pro football.

Campbell, a Denver native and former standout at South High, missed the past two games with a sprained medial collateral ligament in his right knee because of the hit, and Thomas was fined $8,286."
1566,"Government to Announce New Gas Price Formula for 'Difficult Fields': Oil Minister

New Delhi: Government will ""any day"" announce a decision to allow market price for part of gas discoveries made in future from difficult fields, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said on Monday.



 While approving a new gas pricing formula based on international hub rates in October last year, the government had decided that new gas discoveries in deep-water, ultra-deep sea or high-temperature and high-pressure fields will be given a premium over and above the approved price.



 ""There is now an in-principle agreement over the issue of gas price premium between the ministry of petroleum and natural gas and the ministry of finance. It's resolved and it will come any day,"" he told reporters here.



 Based on a recommendation from its upstream technical arm, the ministry proposed to allow a fixed percentage of natural gas produced from difficult fields to be sold at market price and the remaining as per the approved price.



 The ministry had sent the gas price premium proposal to the Finance Ministry which had returned it, saying the Petroleum Ministry should decide on the issue on its own keeping in mind the October 2014 decision of Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA).



 The Oil Ministry subsequently resubmitted the proposal to the Finance Ministry, saying CCEA had in October specifically directed that the gas price premium should be jointly decided by the two ministries based on recommendation of the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH).



 Mr Pradhan, who had recently met Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on the issue, said all issues are settled and an announcement of the gas price premium can be made any day.



 ""It can be done any day, even today,"" he said.



 While domestic gas is priced at $4.66 per million British thermal unit, the market price as measured by the rate at which the fuel is imported is $7-8.



 The percentage of total volumes that can be sold at market price will be different for ultra-deep sea discoveries, deep-sea finds and high-temperature and high-pressure (HTHP) fields.



 All gas producers, including state-owned Oil & Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), have stated that it was uneconomical to produce gas from difficult fields at the current price of $4.66 per mmBtu.



 As per the mechanism approved in October 2014, the price of domestically produced natural gas is to be revised every six months using weighted average or rates prevalent in gas-surplus economies of the US/Mexico, Canada and Russia.



 Gas price, according to the formula, was $5.05 per mmBtu till March 31 and has subsequently been cut to $4.66, in line with international movements.



 The current price is among the lowest in the Asia-Pacific. China pays explorers $11.9 per mmBtu rate for new projects while Indonesia and the Philippines price the fuel at $11 and $10.5, respectively.



 Gas from offshore fields in Myanmar, where Indian firms ONGC and GAIL have a stake, is sold to China for $7.72.



 Thailand prices gas from new projects at $8.2 per mmBtu. Vietnam has a gas price of $5.2 and Malaysia $5."
332,"(Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures fell on Friday ahead of the August jobs report that is expected to feature in the Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates for the first time since 2006.

Nonfarm payrolls is expected to have increased by 220,000 last month, up from 215,000 in July, according to a Reuters survey of economists. The data is due at 8:30 a.m. ET.

A strong report would not only underscore the economy's vibrancy in the face of volatile global financial markets and China's slowing growth, but also keep alive the prospect of the Fed raising rates at its Sept. 16-17 meeting.

Economists acknowledge a risk that job gains could come in below expectations as the first reading of August payrolls in the last several years has tended to be weaker, before being revised higher due to seasonal fluctuations.

The volatile markets have prompted some investors to bet the Fed might wait until the end of the year to hike rates. But Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said last Friday it was still too early to decide if the volatility had made a September hike unfeasible.

The Fed has said it will increase rates when there is sustained economic recovery. While the labor market continues to gain strength, inflation stubbornly remains below the 2 percent target set by the central bank.

U.S. stocks mostly ended higher on Thursday in choppy trading as investors remained on edge ahead of the data.

Near-zero rates have allowed the U.S. stock market to stage a spectacular bull-run since the financial crisis. Higher interest rates increase the cost of borrowing and impact the profit margins of companies.

Arya Singh, 20, a junior in the School of Nursing, died Feb. 8, 2013, after ingesting soluble cyanide crystals in her dorm room.

Singh's life began to unravel after an alleged sexual assault in 2011 by a male student that she reported to authorities, the suit says. No charges were filed against the student, and he remained on campus.

In the two years that followed, Singh increasingly failed to show up for classes. On one occasion, she was arrested and hospitalized for alcohol intoxication. She was subject to multiple academic and misconduct investigations."
2522,"Nineteen of 22 First Nations in the Northwest Territories are among 247 across the country that have yet to file their 2014-2015 financial statements on the Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada website, despite the July 28 deadline.

The 247 figure is as of this past Thursday, with those missing the deadline at risk of having some of their funding withheld.

The federal department says communities that missed the deadline have been notified.

""If these documents are not published by Aug. 28, the department will be withholding their funding for non-essential programs ... beginning Sept. 1, 2015,"" it said.

The First Nations Financial Transparency Act does not apply to self-governed First Nations, such as the Tlicho, which governs a region of four communities near Yellowknife.

The audits include the salaries of chiefs and councillors.

The First Nations Financial Transparency Act came into effect last year. It's been in place longer than Gladys Norwegian, chief of the Jean Marie River First Nation, has been in politics.

""It is what it is and I don't have a problem with it,"" Norwegian said.

The Jean Marie River First Nation has 140 members and only about 40 live in the community, which borders the Mackenzie River.

""We are such a small band, we really don't have large band revenue that we can speak of, as business, so until we get there, I am OK with the Transparency Act.""

But she can't understand why she received a letter in the mail from Aboriginal Affairs on Wednesday about the First Nation's outstanding financial statements.

""Our auditor had sent in the audit report, the same way as he did last year, before the cut-off date,"" she said.

Another community on the tardy list is the K'atlodeeche First Nation near Hay River, N.W.T.

Chief Roy Fabian says the band's audit isn't yet complete.

In an email, Fabian wrote, ""the stipulations for doing the audit each year is getting more and more difficult for First Nations' auditors to complete the reports by the July 29 deadline. Once we get the audit we will post it.""

The federal government was in court in Saskatoon this week to try to force eight First Nations that didn't file financial statements for 2013-2014 to open their books. It has also filed court applications against other bands, including Yukon's Liard First Nation,  that didn't file statements last year.

The Onion Lake band in Saskatchewan is challenging the validity and constitutionality of the law, saying it has no issue providing what Ottawa wants under the act. However, it objects to making the information public on the government's website. Its lawyer argues posting those records online would cause havoc to the businesses owned by the band as it would put competitors at an advantage.

Bill Erasmus, Northwest Territories' regional chief at the Assembly of First Nations, was in Saskatoon for this week's court hearings.

He said he wants the federal government to stop enforcing the act until the federal court makes a decision and releases what he calls ""Indian monies"" from the Treasury Board of Canada.

""We are now into the second quarter and if they are not getting money there's a great burden on their capacity to function as a governing body,"" Erasmus said.

Erasmus blames the Canadian Taxpayers Federation (CTF) for misleading the public when it lobbied for the legislation.

""There ought to be an apology from the taxpayers association because they've caused a great deal of hardship in our communities,"" he said.

Todd MacKay, prairie director of the CTF, said the organization still supports the legislation.

""I am not going to apologize for this,"" MacKay said.

""It makes no sense to say that First Nations people have to go to the band office and humbly ask to see the documentation when every other Canadian can get this information by simply Googling it, whether from city hall or from whichever government they are interested in.""

While MacKay and Erasmus are on opposite sides, they agree on one thing: This should be a federal election issue."
2045,"LAHORE - An accountability court on Saturday sent PPP leader Qasim Zia and another person on 10 days physical remand in a stock exchange business scandal.

Qasim, who is also a hockey Olympian and former president of Pakistan Hockey Federation, was arrested by NAB Lahore for defrauding public of around 80 million rupees, a spokesman of the bureau said.

He said more than 80 victims of financial fraud had approached NAB Lahore against directors of Ali Usman Securities – Qasim Zia and Muhammad Usman Saeed – and an inquiry was initiated against them in 2014.

 Reacting to the arrest, PPP Punjab leaders condemned the arrest of Qasim Zia, former president of party’s Punjab chapter.

 Addressing a news conference here Saturday, PPP leaders including Mian Manzoor Ahmed Wattoo, Tanvir Ashraf Kaira, Manzoor Maneka and Mian Abdul Waheed said that the arrest of Qasim Zia by NAB last night was condemnable because he had not done any criminal act. 

 In a separate statement, party’s finance secretary Aurangzeb Burki termed it a political victimisation and called for an end to unfair treatment of PPP leaders. 

Manzoor Wattoo said Qasim Zia was not arrested on any charges while working as head of the Pakistan Hockey Federation but was apprehended by NAB while working in a private company whose chief executive was not a government official. 

He also welcomed the joining of Chaudhary Ilyas Gujjar and Ayaz Al Karim in the PPP fold who contested Provincial Assembly elections in 2013 from district Okara.

PPP president said that those who had left the PPP were regretting their decision and would continue to do so because they would not be accorded same level of respect and recognition as they were getting in the PPP.

Wattoo demanded that the Punjab government should drop the Metro Train Project of Lahore and spent Rs 165 billion on building dams in the province to save the people from the devastations of floods, adding water would be available to meet the irrigation needs of the farmers.

He maintained that the PML-N was anti-farmers government and they would not cast their votes in favour of the PML-N candidates during the forthcoming local bodies’ elections.

He pointed out that education and health sectors were symbol of neglect of the government as their capacity to provide medical facilities and education were miserable and the government was least pushed to rectify the situation.

Earlier Chaudhary Ilyas Gujjar and Ayaz Karim also spoke on the occasion and expressed their confidence in the leadership of the PPP and announced their joining the party."

Such conditions, coupled with macroeconomic adjustments being made by the government, would weaken domestic demand and foreign investor confidence, it warned.

Brazil has also now technically entered into recession after recording two consecutive quarters of negative growth. Financial markets predict that Brazil's GDP could drop by 2.26 percent this year, the worst fall in 25 years.

The euro’s recovery from this year’s 126.10 low to its early June peak of 141.05 was a 3-wave corrective structure, with all subsequent price action forming a bearish Head and Shoulders continuation formation (refer daily chart below); whereupon a sustained break below the 133.10 support level establishes a (minimum) downside objective of 125.15.





From a wider perspective, the euro is interpreted to be in the early stages of a medium term Wave-c decline (refer weekly chart below), with mathematical projections as low as 117.45 and 115.25 in the months ahead (see weekly chart).

2019,"Widespread changes to U.S. residential mortgage origination practices since the financial crisis have reduced the risk of fraud and misrepresentation, according to Fitch Ratings.

A key driver behind the poor performance of the peak vintage collateral was weak operational controls for the information used in the loan decision process. The industry as a whole, through its own initiatives, investor demands and regulatory mandates, has created a new lending paradigm that has improved the quality of the information and should result in lower credit risk.

Several of the improvements have been driven by legislative changes. In 2008, national standards for non-depository loan officer licenses were introduced for the first time, requiring a written test, completion of education courses and a criminal background check. In 2014, the Ability to Repay rule was implemented, prohibiting 'stated income' loan programs for most mortgage loans. Misrepresentation of income was believed to be common among stated income loan programs. Nowadays, lenders typically do not rely solely on the income documentation provided by borrowers. Most lenders require borrowers to sign Form 4506 T, enabling the lender to verify the income documentation provided by the borrower directly with the IRS.

Lenders have also implemented a number of additional changes to reduce operational and misrepresentation risk. Loan officer compensation now typically includes consideration of quality control results and often includes claw-back provisions for poor performing loans. Similarly, underwriter compensation also typically includes quality control results in addition to volume measures. Quality control reviews pre- and post-closing are now more frequent and comprehensive than prior to 2008.

Components of the loan production process have been separated to prevent inappropriate influence. Underwriting departments and loan origination departments are now typically separated to allow for greater underwriting independence. Direct communication between loan officers and appraisers is typically constrained, and appraisers are now typically selected by an independent Appraisal Management Company or by a lender group outside of production. Many lenders have added specialized internal appraisal underwriting units to either independently review the appraisals or provide a resource for credit underwriters to maintain appraisal quality.

Technology advancements have also played a key role in reducing risk. Fraud risk tools, which were uncommon prior to the financial crisis, are now widely available and heavily used to assess misrepresentation of identity, occupancy, employment/income and a number of other types of fraud, such as non-arms-length transactions, straw-buyers and concurrent closing schemes. Publicly available information on the internet, such as Google Maps and Zillow, are also commonly relied on to review appraisals in ways that were not possible prior to the financial crisis.

1491,"The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported Thursday morning that U.S. natural gas stocks increased by 65 billion cubic feet for the week ending August 4. Analysts polled by The Wall Street Journal expected a storage injection (increase) of 55 billion cubic feet. The five-year average for the week is an increase of around 48 billion cubic feet, and last year’s addition for the week totaled 79 billion cubic feet.

Natural gas futures for October delivery traded down about two cents in advance of the EIA’s report, at around $2.94 per million BTUs, and dipped to about $2.87 following release of the report. Last Thursday, natural gas closed at $2.83 per million BTUs, and over the past five trading days, natural gas futures peaked Wednesday at $2.96. The 52-week low for natural gas futures is $2.64. One year ago the price for a million BTUs was around $3.90.

High temperatures in Texas and the Southeast kept demand up last week and those temperatures have continued into this week. Slightly cooler temperatures are expected in the region beginning this weekend, but temperatures are expected to rise in the Northwest, the Great Lakes region and the Northeast, and with the higher temperatures comes higher demand for cooling and increased demand for natural gas to generate electricity.

Stockpiles are about 21% above their levels of a year ago and about 3% above the five-year average.

The EIA reported that U.S. working stocks of natural gas totaled about 2.977 trillion cubic feet, around 81 billion cubic feet above the five-year average of 2.896 trillion cubic feet and 521 billion cubic feet above last year’s total for the same period. Working gas in storage totaled 2.456 trillion cubic feet for the same period a year ago.

The European Commission has 25 working days after a deal is filed for a first-stage review. It may extend that by 10 working days to 35 working days, to consider either a company's proposed remedies or an EU member state's request to handle the case.

Most mergers win approval but occasionally the Commission opens a detailed second-stage investigation for up to 90 additional working days, which it may extend to 105 working days.

Under the simplified procedure, the Commission announces the clearance of uncontroversial first-stage mergers without giving any reason for its decision. Cases may be reclassified as non-simplified - that is, ordinary first-stage reviews - until they are approved. (Compiled by Foo Yun Chee)"
1098,"While Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV Chief Executive Officer Sergio Marchionne isn’t known for his patience, he’s likely to wait until next year before making a bid for  General Motors Co. after months of talk about the potential of a deal.

The spinoff of  Ferrari SpA, which is slated for early 2016, could be the catalyst for Marchionne to make an offer for the U.S. automaker. Ferrari’s separation would raise money for the debt-laden company. The move is also key for the Agnelli family, Fiat’s dominant shareholder, which is keen to keep control of the Italian supercar maker.

Marchionne has been crusading for consolidation in the auto industry, including in an April presentation called “ Confessions of Capital Junkie.” He argues that automakers waste money by developing multiple versions of the same technology and so should merge.

He’s largely narrowed his focus to GM as a potential target because the two automakers share a multi-brand strategy and GM doesn’t have family shareholders to defend it like Ford Motor Co. GM and Fiat also have a shared history, almost combining a decade ago until GM bought itself out of the deal. Marchionne’s persistent chatter is seen as part of the plan to prod GM into a combination, while GM’s position has been that it’s seeking savings internally and doesn’t need Fiat.

“As a real poker player, Marchionne won’t settle for winning just one hand and getting Chrysler; he wants to go for the jackpot of merging with GM,” said Vincenzo Longo, a strategist at IG Group in Milan. “He’s luring GM investors with talk of multi-billions in savings before making a final push.”

Fiat is committed to spinning off Ferrari and has no plan to include it in a deal, people familiar with the matter said. The supercar unit wouldn’t contribute to cost savings from a merger, and the Agnellis want control of the maker of the $320,000 F12berlinetta sports car, said the people. Fiat declined to comment.

By contrast, the family is ready to have its 29 percent stake in Fiat diluted in a potential deal to expand the company, John Elkann, a descendant of Fiat founder Giovanni Agnelli and the head of the family’s business activities, told Bloomberg in a joint interview with Marchionne in October.

Fiat fell as much as 3.9 percent, trading down 3.1 percent to 12.18 euros at 3:35 p.m. in Milan.

Elkann, 39, hired Marchionne in 2004 to save Fiat from bankruptcy and plays a key role in what the outspoken CEO does. And for the next few months, the Agnelli heir has a lot on his plate after emerging as a deal-maker in his own right this year. As CEO of the family’s holding company Exor SpA, he won a takeover battle for PartnerRe Ltd. and then swooped in for a stake in The Economist Group to become the 172-year-old magazine’s largest investor. Both deals should be closed by the first quarter of 2016.

After Ferrari’s planned initial public offering in October and subsequent spinoff, the Agnelli family will control more than 30 percent of the supercar maker’s voting rights, thanks to a loyalty shareholder program put in place by Marchionne.

In the meantime, the executive is stepping up pressure on GM, which said in June it had vetted and rejected his advances. In an Aug. 30 interview with Automotive News, Marchionne said he’s analyzed a merger of GM and Fiat and that the combined entity could generate $30 billion a year in cash.

He stopped short of saying he’d consider a hostile bid if GM doesn’t change its tune, but he alluded to being ready to strong-arm a deal.

“There are varying degrees of hugs,” Marchionne said in the Automotive News interview. “I can hug you nicely, I can hug you tightly, I can hug you like a bear.”

The Ferrari spinoff could generate more than 3 billion euros ($3.3 billion) for Fiat, including proceeds from the IPO and a 2.25 billion-euro cash payment from Ferrari. After that’s done, the London-based company will have a more stable valuation to determine a potential offer. At the moment, Fiat has a market capitalization of $17.9 billion, compared with GM’s $46.1 billion.

In an all-share transaction, without any premium, Detroit-based GM’s investors would currently get 72 percent of the combined entity. But Fiat’s value is going to be lower after the separation of Ferrari, which Marchionne expects to be worth at least $11 billion, boosting the ratio GM investors would get in a combined entity.

Regardless of the split, the Agnellis would likely end up being at least the second-biggest shareholder in what could be the world’s largest automaker, a reversal from a decade ago. At the time, their wealth was tied to Fiat’s unprofitable auto business. Marchionne started to turn things around, with reluctant help from GM. In 2005, the U.S. automaker paid $2 billion to get out of a deal that would have forced it to buy Fiat.

“With the help of Marchionne, John managed to detangle the Agnelli family from the uncertainties of the car business,” said Giuseppe Berta, a professor at Bocconi University and the former head of Fiat’s archives. “A combination with GM will help John complete the reshuffle.”"
2026,"A man has been arrested in connection with a scam in which members of the public were persuaded to invest in nonexistent Ferrari shares.

The police arrested a 45-year-old, who lives in Swindon, on August 3 on suspicion of fraud by false representation and money laundering. He has been released on bail pending further enquiries.

The scam, in which fraudsters purporting to be ""financial advisers"" from a bogus firm called JC Sterling & Roth cold-called people, was first brought to public attention by this newspaper. We visited the firm's London office, only to find that it did not exist.

Following our expose, victims reported that the fraudsters were still trying to persuade people to invest, explaining away Telegraph Money 's discovery by saying we ""got the wrong address"".

Action Fraud and Wiltshire Police believe a network of criminals is behind the Ferrari shares scam, which means they are likely to be involved in a larger operation connected to a string of similar reported frauds.

A spokesman for Wiltshire Police said: ""We aren’t able to go into any further details as the investigation is still ongoing. There are many other victims and offenders that are subject of ongoing inquiries.""

In May Action Fraud, which acts as a national coordinator for fraud cases, confirmed that Wiltshire Police had started investigating the case.

One saver told Telegraph Money he had handed savings of £176,000 to fraudsters in what was the biggest reported instance of the scam to date.

The fraudsters were operating via a bogus company by the name of Charlton Fitzgerald, which may have been deliberately chosen to sound like Cantor Fitzgerald, the legitimate, regulated broker. They are also known to have used names including JC Sterling & Roth, Larse Captial and Vanquish Wealth Management.

The “opportunity” to buy Ferrari shares proved convincing to some investors, largely because it was based on a half truth.

Fiat Chrysler, the firm that owns Ferrari, has said it will sell some of its shares to the public later this year, but at the time the scam was operating its shares were not available to buy.

More recently another firm called Pfeifferroth & Schaffer Private Asset Management has been reported to be selling shares in Uber, the app-based taxi service, ahead of its forthcoming flotation.

Pension experts and the Government have warned of a rise in scams and unregulated investment sales as an unintended consequence of new pension freedoms introduced in April.

British savers are being advised to ignore calls from “advisers” offering investment opportunities of any kind.

2332,"NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group (BABA) has not had a great 2015.

Shares have sunk 24% for the year. The Hangzhou-based company hasn't pleased investors, despite a year-over-year 45% increase in 2015 fourth- quarter revenue. 

 ¿

The online retailer reports its fiscal, first-quarter results for 2016 on Wednesday before the opening bell.

But things are about to change, largely on the strength of an ambitious cloud initiative. That combined with continued growth among consumers should send the stock higher. 



Alibaba has never shied away from comparisons to Amazon.com (AMZN - Get Report) or what has often been perceived as copying Amazon's playbook. Alibaba recently announced plans to invest $1 billion over the next three years to build its cloud capabilities. A similar strategy has made Amazon a premier technology power.

In its second-quarter earnings, Seattle-based Amazon reported an 81% year-over-year surge in its dominant Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform, reaching almost $2 billion. Profits from its cloud division skyrocketed more than fivefold, sending Amazon stock surging nearly 10% a day after the report. 



Alibaba, whose share price has stagnated, believes it's cloud bet will pay off in similar fashion.

Working in its favor, the company already has significant cloud resources in place. Alibaba is already the leading cloud-computing vendor in China, with its Aliyun cloud segment taking up more than 20% of the country's market share. 



This is a small business for Alibaba since its cloud computing segments accounts for less than 2% of its sales, but it took Amazon more than decade to grow its AWS service.

To accelerate the growth of its cloud market, Alibaba is looking to expand overseas, having earlier this year built its first data center in Silicon Valley. The move will support Silicon Valley-based clients. With its headstart in infrastructure, Alibaba is primed for long-term success in the cloud space.



At least one analyst, Bob Peck of SunTrust, believes Alibaba can grow its cloud business to become a $1 billion franchise within three years.

Expect first-quarter revenue to come in higher-than-expected. But also expect that even if earnings beat expectations, investors won't be happy. 



Alibaba's strength is in future -- remember that Amazon was not too-long ago just a blip on a radar screen but recently passed Wal-Mart  (WMT - Get Report) in market capitalization. 



Buy shares of Alibaba and hold for the long term."

2459,"Best Buy BBY continued its remarkable turnaround last quarter, with a big assist from Apple AAPL .

The largest U.S. electronics retailer reported a rise in domestic comparable sales of 3.8% for the second quarter, well ahead of Wall Street’s expectations, and posted a better than expected profit. While Best Buy has helped its cause by cutting costs and adding floor space to growing categories like smart homes, home theaters, and shops-within-a-shop for top brands, it has also been getting a lot of help from Apple and its roster of red-hot products.

“Demand for Apple Watch has been so strong in the stores and online,” Best Buy CEO Hubert Joly told Wall Street analysts on a conference call. The retailer expects to be selling the device, which hit the market in June, at all of its 1,050 big-box stores by the end of September, he added. Initially, Best Buy had planned to have watches in 300 stores by the holiday season. (It started selling the watches in early August.) Apple did not provide specific sales numbers for the watch in its second-quarter earnings last month, but Best Buy’s comments provide more evidence of the device’s success.

Joly also announced steps that will deepen Best Buy’s relationship with Apple. It is currently updating its Apple shop-in-shops at 740 stores, including new fixtures and more display tables for phones, computers, and tablets. The work is already complete at 350 stores, and will be finished at another 170 in time for the key holiday season. He also said that Best Buy will begin selling AppleCare product service and support this quarter, and will start testing out being an authorized service provider at 50 stores.

Beyond Apple, there was a lot for investors to cheer: e-commerce sales grew by 17%, showing that Best Buy can hold its own against Walmart WMT , Target TGT , and Amazon.com AMZN , and suggests it has licked the “show rooming” phenomenon, where shoppers go to a store to browse and try products out, then buy them on Amazon, behavior that a few years ago led many to question Best Buy’s long term viability.

“The company continues to gain meaningful traction online and therefore enhance its formidable competitive position,” said Moody’s analyst Charlie O’Shea in a research note. Moody’s raised its credit rating on Best Buy to Baa1 on Monday.

And in a development that should worry Sears SHLD , Best Buy reported strong appliance sales, a key driver of its comparable sales jump.

Still, Best Buy sounded a note of caution about the current quarter, forecasting U.S. sales to be flat or grow by a low single-digit percentage rate.

As for all the stock market drama of late? The jury is still out on whether consumers will pull back.

“It is difficult to know, though, if the recent volatility in the financial markets will affect overall consumer spending,” Chief Financial Officer Sharon McCollam said in a statement. “To date, however, we have not seen a measurable impact versus our original expectations.”"
1721,"For the last few years, I have been sporadically writing on what is now known as Equity Commonwealth (NYSE:EQC), and more specifically, the former management of the REIT, REIT Management and Research (""RMR"") - last two articles here and here.

Today, I once again see the cheese in the mousetrap with three other REITs managed by RMR, namely Select Income REIT (NYSE:SIR), Government Properties Income Trust (NYSE:GOV), Senior Housing Properties Trust (NYSE:SNH) and Hospitality Properties Trust (NYSE:HPT).

The basic fundamentals of these REITs are as follows:

As the table above shows, there is some cheese (dividend yield) in these REITs, as they yield from 7.9% to 11.1%. With the exception of SIR, these REITs trade at ""value"" metrics.

Let's take a look at these REITs versus peers:

Without exception, the RMR REITs trade at discounts to their peers. Have we discovered a gold mine?

Let's now look at some metrics in graphical form (a picture is worth a thousand words, and, quite frankly, I don't think anyone wants to read a couple thousand words on these REITs):

Far and away, these REITs crush the competitors when it comes to dividend yield.

Most of us like to buy things at ""value"" prices as well. Looking at a P/FFO metric, every REIT in the RMR mine trades at a discount.

As well, many of us don't like paying a premium when we can buy a REIT near book value. With the exception of HPT, the RMR stable can be had at or near book value.

Yield and value, the makings of a gold mine. Unless, of course, when you go to cash in your stake:

These REITs have underperformed over virtually all time periods, some negative over all time periods. Here is a look at the amount of underperformance:

And when viewed versus the REIT market (represented by Vanguard's REIT ETF VNQ):

What is better than owning REITs that have underperformed due in part to their external manager?

Senior Housing Properties Trust, Hospitality Properties Trust, Select Income REIT and Government Properties Income Trust (each a ""REIT"" and, collectively, the ""REITs"") today announced that they have acquired combined economic ownership of approximately half of Reit Management & Research LLC (""RMR""). Each of the REITs is managed by RMR and, simultaneously with the REITs' acquisition of ownership in RMR, the management agreements with RMR were amended and extended for 20 year terms. The REITs' ownership in RMR is held indirectly through a new holding company of RMR (""RMR INC""). Pursuant to the agreements entered for this transaction, the REITs have agreed to distribute approximately half of the RMR INC shares held by them to their shareholders as a special dividend, and RMR INC has agreed to facilitate this by filing a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") to register the RMR INC shares to be distributed and by seeking a listing of those shares on a national stock exchange upon the registration statement being declared effective by the SEC.

Owning part of the manager itself. As it says, the REITs controlled by RMR will own 48.4% of RMR, of which 24.2% will be spun out to shareholders of these REITs. Bottom line: RMR sold a less than controlling interest of the management company to REITs it controls, which will spin half of these shares to shareholders. In the end, RMR will still have 51.6% of the company and indirectly (through its controlled REITs) control 24.2%, for a controlled block of 75.8% - plus, a management agreement extended by 20 years, and larger holdings of its managed REITs.

At least there isn't any potential conflict of interest:

In addition to managing the REITs, RMR provides management services to other publicly traded and private businesses, including: TravelCenters of America, LLC (NYSE: TA), an operator of travel centers along the U.S. Interstate Highway System, some of which are owned by HPT; Five Star Quality Care, Inc. (NYSE: FVE), an operator of senior living communities, some of which are owned by SNH; Sonesta International Hotels Corporation (""Sonesta""), a privately owned manager and franchisor of hotels in the U.S., Latin America, and the Middle East, some of which are owned by HPT; as well as other privately held businesses.

Interestingly, the closed-end fund run by RMR, the RMR Real Estate Income Fund (NYSEMKT:RIF), doesn't hold shares of the REITs it manages (March holdings here). The net result of the avoidance:

The RMR stable of REITs including Select Income REIT, Government Properties Income Trust, Senior Housing Properties Trust and Hospitality Properties Trust are, in my opinion, fool's gold, offering the glitter of a high dividend yield, while underperforming both their peers and the REIT market generally.

While the dividend yield of these funds is not easily replaceable, an investor would be better off investing in strong management that can create positive returns over the long term (a higher yield and strong management makes EPR Properties (NYSE:EPR) come to mind). If the higher yield is necessary to hit certain bogeys, one might want to look within the preferred stock space."
199,"One argument against a September rate hike is that it would be just the surprise move the Federal Reserve had hoped to avoid.

For months, Fed officials have said they want to be transparent about their monetary tightening game plan, with the hope that by telegraphing their intent to raise rates for the first time in nearly a decade, the central bank would mitigate any disruptions in financial markets.

But August’s wild swings have tripped up the U.S. central bank, for the September meeting at least.

In May, William Dudley, the president of the New York Fed, said the central bank’s conditions for a rate hike were so clear that “market participants should be able to think right along with policy makers, adjusting their views about the prospects for normalization in response to the incoming data.”

But investors have dumped stocks this month, spooked by economic distress signals from China and other key emerging markets, and concern about Fed tightening into such a weak global environment.

Given all this volatility and concern over China, the watchword from Jackson Hole summit was uncertainty about the likelihood of a September rate hike. Highlighting the uncertainty, one Fed official, Dennis Lockhart of the Atlanta Fed, put the chances of a rate hike in September at 50-50.

“If the market doesn’t have a rate hike priced in…the Fed will have a real communication problem in raising rates if financial markets don’t expect it,” said Joe LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank.

Traders who bet on the future path of fed-funds rate have put a 28% chance of a rate hike in September, according to the CME’s FedWatch tool, which gauges the probability of a rate hike in a given month.

“This is such an unusual situation, there is such a high level of uncertainty,” said Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Capital Markets America Inc., who thinks the Fed may hold off until October.

Moran said Fed officials look like they will go into the September meeting with “an open mind rather than a committed position.”

“They will talk to each other and make a decision,” he said. This rules out any pre-signal to financial markets.

At Jackson Hole, Fed officials said they may hike rates if financial markets settle down.

But there is circular logic at work, Moran said, pointing to the fact that the Fed’s vagueness about a September move creates volatility in markets, and in turn, forces the Fed to rethink its liftoff timing.

U.S. stock markets were slumping Monday as investors weighted the chances of a Fed move.

Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer and New York Fed President William Dudley, two members of the inner circle of Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen, appear to be leaning in opposite directions, said Anna Markowska, chief U.S. economist at Société Générale in New York.

Dudley appeared to take a September rate hike off the table in comments in midweek. This seemed to settle markets down. But Fischer didn’t rule out a September move in comments from Jackson Hole, leading to renewed volatility.

“So now, Yellen is the tiebreaker. That’s a difficult position,” Markowska said."
229,"Maryland state revenue came in $214 million higher than officials projected for fiscal 2015, according to figures released Thursday by the state comptroller’s office.

Comptroller Peter Franchot (D) said revenue for fiscal 2015, which ended June 30, was $15.9 billion, amounting to a 5.1 percent increase over the previous fiscal year.

Franchot said the numbers suggest good news about the state’s economy, but he urged Gov. Larry Hogan (R) and the General Assembly to show fiscal restraint given the state’s “near-term economic outlook.”

“These revenue figures highlight an economy that has improved but is still fragile and has not returned to pre-recession growth rates,” Franchot said in a statement. “We must proceed with the utmost caution and continue on a prudent fiscal course in the months ahead.”

Hogan applauded the economic progress, pointing out that some of the additional revenue was the result of his administration’s effort to clamp down on government spending.

According to the figures, state officials had estimated that there would be $30 million in reversions, or temporary reductions, from state agencies for the year. Instead, the total was $84 million, the largest amount since fiscal 2003, the governor’s office said.

The $54 million in cuts by state agencies represented a quarter of the higher-than-anticipated revenue.

The close-out figures show that there is $295 million in the state’s general-fund balance.

“Our growing revenues mean Marylanders are making more money, and that means Maryland businesses are making more money,” Hogan said in a statement. “All this points to a growing economy that puts us on a positive path moving forward.”

The state budget was the biggest point of contention between Hogan and the Democratic-

controlled legislature this year, with the two sides battling over how much money should be spent on education funding and pension fund contributions.

On Thursday, Franchot continued to express concern about the state’s overall pace of economic recovery from the 2008 recession.

For example, he said, wages, salaries and consumer spending all showed moderate improvement but have yet to return to pre-recession levels.

Withholding receipts were up 3.9 percent from the previous year, and sales and use tax receipts jumped by 5 percent.

But Franchot attributed some of the increase to the opening this spring of Amazon’s distribution center in Baltimore, which resulted in the state receiving sales tax on Amazon orders. He said receipts are “still weaker” than those collected before the recession.

The comptroller said Maryland, which relies heavily on federal jobs, continues to feel the consequences of sequestration and to experience high unemployment — 5.2 percent in July, compared with 4.3 percent before the recession."
2122,"A settlement in a lawsuit over the car used in the 1985 film ""Back to the Future"" has hit a roadblock.

Last year, the widow of automaker John DeLorean sued a Texas company she said has been illegally using the DeLorean name for years. The DMC-12, known simply as ""the DeLorean,"" was driven by Michael J. Fox in the movie and has since gained a cult following.

The two sides in the lawsuit reached a preliminary settlement in June that would pay an undisclosed amount of money to Sally DeLorean, who lives in New Jersey with her daughter. But her attorney wrote in a letter to the judge this week that the company's lawyers were trying to change the settlement at the last minute.

The company is seeking to have DeLorean's estate say on the record that its case had no merit and also ""consent to the use by the Defendant of the name DeLorean for virtually any purpose,"" attorney R. Scott Thompson wrote.

In a response letter to the judge filed Thursday, an attorney for the Texas-based DeLorean Motor Company denied those claims and said the company just wants language in the settlement that ensures it isn't sued in the future and that ""allows them simply to carry on their business as it has been operated in the past 20 plus years.""

Attorneys for both sides didn't respond to emails seeking comment Thursday.

John DeLorean, an automotive innovator who began his career at General Motors before forming his own company in the 1970s, died in New Jersey in 2005 at age 80 after years of court battles that included a highly publicized drug trial in the 1980s in which he was acquitted of conspiring to sell millions of dollars of cocaine. His former estate in the rolling hills about 40 miles west of New York City was converted into a golf course by Donald Trump in 2004.

Only about 9,000 DeLorean cars were produced before the company went bankrupt in the early 1980s, but the car's sleek, angular look and gull-wing doors helped land it a role in the ""Back To The Future"" films.

Sally DeLorean's suit claims the DeLorean Motor Company has been illegally using the DeLorean name to sell hats, pens, notebooks, key chains and other items, and has illegally licensed the name and images to other companies including Nike, Mattel, Urban Outfitters and Apple. The company has never been formally affiliated with the one DeLorean started.

NEW YORK (RealMoney) -- The uncertainty that continues to roil global equity markets has done little to give anyone confidence to invest in commodities as an asset class.

News that product inventories rose in the past week has more than offset the 5-million-barrel draw in oil, renewing bearish sentiment in the energy patch. At least energy equities have sponsorship, as shown by the 13f filings by large hedge funds. Gold, on the other hand, which seems to go down a lot easier than it goes up, has lost most of its high-profile sponsors, with the exception of Duquesne.

I continue to feel that as long as central banks continue to add to reserves, it makes sense to have a bit of gold in your portfolio in an environment where global central banks look confused. Fed Governor William Dudley's statement that September seemed to be less compelling for a Fed rate hike but may change in three weeks' time is indicative of that confusion, but it certainly has not given any bullish sentiment to gold.

Industrial commodities continue to live in a correlation-one environment, but the People's Bank of China cut to the lending rate, deposit rate and reserve ratio will do little to cure the domestic-growth ills. I believe the focus of the cuts was to help the banks, as margin borrowing is the real concern on the back of the dramatic equity retreat.

I understand a lack of macro buying interest in bulk commodities or LME metals until producers cut back, as emerging-market demand is still weakening. I do not understand the weakness in palladium, as I felt it was one major hedge fund long liquidation yesterday, which overextended the selloff of a metal that will be in deficit for years.

That said, above-ground stocks and recycling activity have helped close the deficit a bit more than anticipated."
693,"A development that renovates foreclosed houses on Milwaukee's north side into affordable rental homes for families has received additional public financing help.

Gorman & Co.'s Northside Housing Initiative has renovated dozens of houses in recent years and rented them at below-market rates to lower-income families. Gorman buys the houses from the city, which acquires them through property tax foreclosure.

The Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority announced Thursday that Gorman is receiving federal affordable housing tax credits totaling $850,000 to help finance the latest phase of the development. Developers typically sell the credits to raise equity financing."

Tim Gould on the championship course in Andorra. Picture: Jill Smith-Gould.

TIM Gould conquered a brutal course in Andorra to land a silver medal in the Masters Mountain Bike World Championships.

The 50-year-old former pro from Matlock, in his comeback season, missed out on the chance to win when the French favourite, Jean-Luc Gagnon, punctured and crashed in front of him, bringing him down.

But Gould had no complaints after finishing one minute and 50 seconds behind Spaniard Javier Salamero.

""The result was fair – I was going as fast as I could go,"" he said afterwards.

The Frenchman had not, apparently, been beaten in a mountain bike race for some years.

And it was soon he, Salamero and Gould – who had driven from England to Andorra to compete – who were contesting the leading places.

Gould's father, Harry, was at the race and said: ""The course called for a high degree of technical competence, as it was a brutal mixture of short, vicious climbs and descents as well as a winding climb followed by a very fast descent.""

The course was at a ski resort but the race was in temperatures of up to 37C and riders had to take a chairlift to the start.

""Apart from the section on the actual ski slope, the surface was best described as covered with broken rock, some of it quite sharp,"" said Harry Gould.

""The race began with the first climb, which was the longest and Salamero, Gagnon and Tim were at the head of affairs.

""Then everything changed! The Frenchman suddenly stopped dead.

""Tim ran into the back of him, fell off and he was down to 10th.

""After the race was over, he found Tim and apologised for what had happened – his rear tyre had burst and jammed his bike.

""For 20 minutes or so, Tim attempted to retrieve his earlier position and, with two laps to go, he was in a group of four attempting to catch Salamero.

""He managed to overtake Keld Pedersen of Denmark to take second place and left everyone in his wake except the Spaniard, who was gaining several seconds a lap on him.""

""Tim badly wanted to add a gold medal to his collection but a silver is good and it's possible he will have another attempt at the 2016 World Championships, which will be held in either Italy or the Czech Republic.""

700,"Foreclosures aren't as big a part of the housing market as they were just after the recession, but they're still a sizable portion of homes sold across the U.S.

Housing data site RealtyTrac found that sales of properties in foreclosure are down from a year ago to multi-year lows, while year-to-date U.S. home sales in 2015 are at an eight-year high. The sale of properties sold while in the foreclosure process (not including bank-owned properties) accounted for 6.4 percent of all single family and condo sales in July, down from 6.6 percent of all sales in June and down from 8.0 percent in July 2014.

Meanwhile, the National Association of Realtors found that distressed properties -- including both foreclosures and short sales -- declined to 7 percent of all homes in July from 8 percent in June and 9 percent a year ago. Some 5 percent of July sales were foreclosures, and 2 percent were short sales. Foreclosures sold for an average discount of 17 percent below market value in July (15 percent in June), while short sales were discounted 12 percent (18 percent in June). Comparatively speaking, that isn't such a bad thing.

""Five years ago, distressed sales represented 33 percent of the market in July,"" said Chris Polychron, president of the National Association of Realtors and executive broker with 1st Choice Realty in Hot Springs, Arkansas. ""For many previously distressed homeowners throughout the country, rising home values in recent years have helped recover equity and the vast improvement in several local job markets means fewer are falling behind on their mortgage payments.""

That doesn't necessarily mean everything is going extraordinarily well. The U.S. median existing home sales price in July was $235,500, up 5.8 percent from a year earlier. While there are fewer all-cash sales driving that rising price, there are still reasons to proceed with caution.

""While the stock market may be on a roller coaster as of late, the housing market is still on solid ground, with the eight-year low in cash sales combined with the eight-year high in overall sales volume in the first half of the year evidence that housing is successfully transitioning from an investor-driven recovery to one that is drawing in traditional buyers as a good foundation for sustainable growth going forward,"" said Daren Blomquist, vice president at RealtyTrac. ""That's not to say there are no cracks in the foundation of this recovery, the top three of which are housing affordability -- or lack thereof in some high-flying markets -- along with over-dependence on capricious cash buyers -- both foreign and domestic -- in some markets, and the persistent overhang of underwater homeowners who continue to represent heightened default risk given any future economic shockwaves.""

In 61 of the 172 markets RealtyTrac analyzed for in-foreclosure sales, the share of those sales increased from a year ago, counter to the national trend.

""The increase in overall foreclosure activity over the last five months has been driven primarily by rapidly rising bank repossessions, which in July reached the highest level since January 2013,"" said Blomquist. ""Meanwhile foreclosure starts in July were at the lowest level since November 2005 -- a nearly ten-year low that demonstrates the recent rise in bank repossessions represents banks flushing out old distress rather than new distress being pushed into the pipeline.""

That's good news for much of the U.S. but not for certain corners of it. With help from RealtyTrac, we found the locations where foreclosures still make up a significant portion of home sales, despite improvements in the overall economy. Each has its own story to tell.

1681,"Zoe McBride and Adam Ling won gold at the world rowing championships in France on Friday night (NZ time) in their respective lightweight women's and men's single scull finals.

McBride, 19, who won two World Cup titles and set a new world's best time for the class earlier this year, was the dominant figure as she pulled away from her rivals to win in a time of seven minutes 32.45 seconds - 1.54s quicker than silver medallist Imogen Walsh of Great Britain with Kathleen Bertko (US) taking bronze.

Her triumph came the race after Ling produced a wonderfully-timed effort to claim gold in the dying stages. The sculler, who will have a memorable 24th birthday on Wednesday, came from fourth after 500m and second with 500 to row to head off Slovenia's Rajko Hrvat by 0.79s with a winning time of 6:53.80.

McBride currently competes in a non-Olympic class but her efforts this year have set up a fascinating battle over summer ahead of the national trials, where she will seek a place in the women's lightweight double scull boat. That's currently occupied by Julia Edward and Sophie MacKenzie, who will defend their world championship crown from Amsterdam last year on Saturday night (NZ Time).

Ling also competes in a non-Olympic category but has also indicated this year that he will be pushing the incumbents in the lightweight men's four for a place in Rio - or possibly put into the lightweight double to push for one of two available places at next year's last chance regatta in Europe in May.

Earlier, another four New Zealand boats sealed places for the 2016 Rio Olympics at the world champs.

The Rowing NZ boats recorded a perfect four-from-four result at Aiguebelette as all four semifinal entries advanced to the finals while also securing guaranteed spots in Rio with their results. New Zealand are now assured of seven boats to contest next year's Olympic Games regatta, with the possibility of another four to claim places over the final two days at the world champs.

The women's double scull crew of Zoe Stevenson and Eve Macfarlane have come from behind previously this year to score victories but led for most of the way in their semifinal triumph.

Stevenson teamed up with Fiona Bourke over the last two years to win silver in 2013 and gold last year at Amsterdam, but with Bourke in the single this year, Macfarlane has made a seamless adjustment with the boat capturing gold at the two lead-up World Cup regattas.

Their winning time of 6:52.35 saw off regular rivals Lithuania and Great Britain, while the other finalists will be Greece - who recorded the fastest time of 6:51.86 - Poland and Germany.

With the top 11 crews qualifying the boat for the Olympics, Stevenson and Macfarlane easily booked the double a spot in the Olympic regatta next year.

Chris Harris and Robbie Manson produced a bold and dogged effort to qualify from their men's double scull semifinal.

The Kiwi duo hung tightly to gold medal favourites Martin and Valent Sinkovic of Croatia for the majority of the 2000m and while passed by Australia, they hung on to nab third just ahead of Italy. They were far more comfortable in ensuring the men's double scull boat will be in Rio too, with the top 11 taking places.

As expected, the German crew of Stephan Krueger and Marcel Hacker won the second semifinal, ahead of Lithuania and France.

The Kiwi men's lightweight four of Curtis Rapley, James Lassche, Alistair Bond and James Hunter also had to fight all the way to claim third place in the first semifinal to take a place in the final.

Last year's world champs runners-up again had to bow to their 2014 conquerors Denmark, with the Netherlands just nabbing second ahead of the Kiwis, who were never in danger of not making the last six and put the boat on the start line at the 2016 Olympic regatta for the first time in NZ history with their top 11 finish clinched.

The other finalists will be Switzerland - coached by New Zealand's Ian Wright and likely to start favourite after recording the quickest time - France and Italy.

Mahe Drysdale's quest for a sixth world championship crown remained well on track with his win in the second men's single scull semifinal.

The 36-year-old led throughout to win in 6:45.08, heading off Croatia's Damir Martin and Norwegian veteran and duel Olympic champ Olaf Tufte.

The first semifinal was won by Lithuania's Mindaugas Griskonis in 6:47.35, ahead of defending champ Ondrej Synek of the Czech Republic with Cuba's Angel Fournier Rodriguez third.

Olympic qualification for the boat was never in doubt for Drysdale, with the top nine finishers earning places for their country at Rio."
2204,"DES MOINES, Iowa -- The insurance company for Des Moines Public Schools has settled a lawsuit filed by Nancy Sebring.

The lawsuit was in regards to the release of emails from the former superintendent's school district account. Sebring was suing the school district, and several members of the school board for invasion of privacy, emotional distress, and interference with a contract.

The insurance company for the Des Moines Public School District has agreed to a settlement of $350,000. Half of the settlement will go to Sebring and half will be given to her attorneys. The funds from the district’s budget will not be used, according to Amanda Lewis, Communications Officer for Des Moines Public Schools.

The school district thought they would win this case at the court level based on recent rulings, according to Lewis. The court has ruled over the past two months that the emails are public record under the state's laws.

However, to avoid additional expenses and the uncertainty of ongoing litigation from Sebring appealing the court's previous rulings, the insurance company for the school district ultimately chose to settle.

Sebring did release a statement through her attorney Monday saying:

""The lawsuit I vigorously pursued for more than two years was my attempt to shed light on issues regarding employee privacy. Now that the case is settled, I am free to bring attention to this topic in other ways. Having experienced the devastating effects of having purely private information go viral, I am in a unique position to add insight to the national conversation regarding individual privacy in the information age."""

69,"Things to watch during the Southeastern Conference's opening weekend:

GAME OF THE WEEK: No. 15 Arizona State vs. Texas A&M at Houston: Alabama-Wisconsin and Louisville-Auburn also are appealing matchups, but Arizona State-Texas A&M carries the most intrigue. It's a relatively rare matchup between the SEC and the Pac-12, regarded as the nation's strongest conferences. This game also features promising quarterbacks in Arizona State's Mike Bercovici and Texas A&M's Kyle Allen. Arizona State will be seeking its first win over an SEC opponent in seven attempts.

MATCHUP OF THE WEEK: Wisconsin running back Corey Clement vs. Alabama run defense: Melvin Gordon has moved on to the NFL after capping a spectacular college career by running over Auburn in the Outback Bowl, but Wisconsin churns out star running backs with assembly-line precision. Next up is Corey Clement, who rushed for 949 yards and nine touchdowns last season. Clement has averaged 7 yards per carry in his career but could have trouble finding that much running room against Alabama, which has allowed only 15 individuals to run for 100 yards or more since 2005.

NUMBERS GAME: Five of the seven teams in the SEC West Division are ranked in the Top 25: No. 3 Alabama, No. 6 Auburn, No. 14 LSU, No. 17 Ole Miss and No. 18 Arkansas. The only West Division members not in the Top 25 — Mississippi State and Texas A&M — received the most votes of any unranked teams. ... Since 2006, the SEC has a 442-98 (.819) record in non-conference games (including regular-season contests and bowls) to lead all conferences.

LONG SHOT: Kentucky is a 17-point favorite over Louisiana-Lafayette, which is coming off its fourth-consecutive 9-4 season. The Ragin' Cajuns have consistently been one of the Sun Belt's best teams but must replace three-year starter Terrance Broadway at quarterback. ... Auburn is a 10 ½-point favorite over Louisville, which seems reasonable, but there's always the chance that Cardinals coach Bobby Petrino has a few surprises waiting for the Tigers.

IMPACT PERFORMER: A lot of eyes will be on Auburn quarterback Jeremy Johnson, who has received quite a bit of hype despite being relatively inexperienced. He did well in limited time last season, completing 28 of 37 passes for 436 yards and three touchdowns. He'll have a tough test on Saturday against Louisville."
707,"Cooperative Housing Corporation (CHC) has housing units available immediately for low-to-moderate income senior citizens in Somerset County. CHC housing includes private spacious rooms in single-level ranch homes for singles and couples, with fees for rent and services based on each individual’s income and assets.

“The rapidly rising cost of supportive housing and long-term care for seniors puts a tremendous burden on both senior citizens and their families,” said Angelo DiOrio, Executive Director, Cooperative Housing Corporation. “CHC is pleased to offer a services-based solution with available units that provide beautiful and affordable places to live, based on an individual’s ability to pay.”

While the term “long term care” (LTC) is most often associated with medical or health based care, such as Assisted Living or Nursing Homes, the reality is that for many seniors the “long” part begins well before the need for that kind of “care”. Frequently, what is required is simply a housing arrangement that includes some supportive services, and not daily medical assistance. As the cost of nursing and assisted living settings continues to skyrocket, alternatives to defer their need for such care are critical to the average senior. CHC offers a senior housing option that extends a senior’s ability to afford a longer period of self-budgeted LTC.

CHC offers two different types of housing for seniors age 62 and older, with income less than $58,600: Independent living for seniors who are capable of managing their own needs, and Supportive housing for seniors who need some assistance with the activities of daily living. Fees for rent never exceed 40% of one’s income while services are paid for on a sliding scale based on each individual’s income and assets. One monthly combined fee includes all CHC expenses!

In CHC homes, residents have their own private suite with bedroom and full bathroom, and share the spacious common areas including living room, dining room, porch, den, spa and hobby room. This shared living model offers the best of both worlds: privacy in one’s own space, yet companionship when desired.

“I enjoy living here because I have my own room and the company of my housemates at the same time,” said Don Sayre, 83, Bridgewater. “I love having my own bathroom!”

Food preparation, housekeeping, even nursing oversight, are provided at a fraction of the cost of other housing alternatives, while Cooperative Housing actively promotes independent living, in a mutually supportive environment. Residents enjoy the comforts of sharing a ranch-style house rather than a large facility. To learn more, visit www.CHChousing.org or call 908-526-8130."
1261,"One of the underreported benefits of the recently announced mergers of health insurers Anthem and Cigna, and Aetna and Humana, is that it should speed up innovation in health care.

There is little doubt consolidation will give insurers greater bargaining power with which to negotiate better rates with providers. It will also reduce administrative overhead. Aetna estimates, for example, that the Humana merger could produce approximately $1.25 billion in annual cost savings by 2018. But such savings are minuscule when you consider that total U.S. health-care spending last year was in the neighborhood of $3.8 trillion.

135,"St. Kitts and Nevis (WINN): The Monetary Council of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank has expressed sorrow and regret at the devastation to Dominica caused by Tropical Storm Erika. A statement by the Chairman of the Monetary Council Victor Banks says the people of Dominica are strong and resilient to overcome this challenge.

“On behalf of the Monetary Council of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank, I express profound sorrow and regret to the Government and people of the Commonwealth of Dominica for the devastation caused by Tropical Storm Erika,” Mr. Banks said. “Our prayers and thoughts are with the families who have lost loved ones and with those whose family members and friends are still missing or injured. We are grateful to God for the lives that have been spared and hope that the people who are still missing will be rescued unharmed.”

Mr. Bank said the infrastructural damage is widespread and extensive and that the process of rebuilding will be costly and will take some time. “However, we know that the people of Dominica are strong and resilient and have the spirit to overcome this enormous challenge. Please be assured that we, the members of the Monetary Council, stand in solidarity with you at this time of immense loss,” Mr. Banks added.

Meanwhile, Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) announced that an Emergency Relief Grant of USD 200,000 is being made immediately available to the Government of Dominica in the wake of Tropical Storm Erika. The grant is being provided in accordance with the CDB’s Disaster Management Strategy and Operational Guidelines, and is aimed at assisting the country in its response to the disaster. Emergency Relief Grants are coordinated through the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency, based on damage and needs assessments and in close coordination with the development community, a release from the CDB said.

Vice-President of Operations at CDB, Patricia McKenzie said: “We are saddened by the loss of life and how the disruption caused by this storm will affect the lives of Dominicans. We are in touch with the Government of Dominica; working with CDEMA and are standing by to provide concessionary financing, in addition to the grant, to help the country rebuild.”

Previously disbursed Emergency Relief Grants included: assistance to St. Vincent following the Christmas Trough in December 2013; and to The Bahamas, Jamaica and Haiti following the passage of Hurricane Sandy in 2012. In 2007 the Emergency Relief Grant was also made available to the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Relief Agency (CDERA) to support several countries affected by Hurricane Dean."

1670,"Evolution Mining's executive chairman Jake Klein had just completed a very bullish presentation to the Sydney Mining Club on Thursday when Chanticleer stumped him with one simple question – how do you value a gold company? Klein was brutally honest when he said anyone can prepare a spreadsheet to value a gold mining company but the determinants of value all depend upon the assumptions made. The assumptions are as long as your arm based on the latest analysis of the drivers of the gold price published by analysts at Nomura. The top seven key drivers of the gold price are: the US dollar, US real interest rates, risk sentiment, central bank buying and selling of gold, mine supply, Chinese demand and Indian demand. Nomura this week reviewed all these drivers this week and the conclusions for gold bugs were not good.

A strong US dollar is bad for gold because gold is primarily traded in US dollars. The US dollar is up 5.9 per cent this year and that is weighing on the gold price. Positive real interest rates make gold a less attractive asset. It is bearish for gold when US Treasury bonds yield more than non-yielding gold on an inflation adjusted basis and with a Fed induced lift off in rates due later this year that spells more volatility for the gold price. Changing risk sentiment affects gold but the recent sell-off in shares in China did little to boost gold buying, according to Nomura. Central banks in emerging economies are expected to buy less gold in the future after being big buyers in recent years.

Long term mine supply is expected to fall as global mine grades are declining. The Nomura analysts conclude that there was a 191-tonne surplus of gold in the first half of 2015, which is almost equal to the 205-tonne surplus for the entire year of 2014.    There are mixed messages from China. In the first six months of the year, China's jewellery scrap volumes rose 9 per cent year on year to 85 tonnes, while jewellery and physical bar and coins fell 22 per cent year on year to 357 tonnes, according to GFMS data, Nomura said. ""Recent yuan devaluation and fall in the gold price did not see a similar gold rush buying in April 2013,"" the broker said. The broker remains bullish longer term. ""Cultural affinity to gold as well as rising middle-class income and urbanisation would provide support to global demand,"" it said. India recorded a pick-up in August gold imports but that was likely due to earlier restocking, rather than consumer demand. Put all that together and there are plenty of reasons to be cautious about buying gold or purchasing shares in gold miners.

Klein told the Sydney Mining Club that the two biggest factors working in favour of Evolution Mining were the quality of its mines and the depreciation in the Australian dollar. The fall in the dollar has lowered the cost of production and lifted the amount earned from each ounce of gold sold in US dollars. Evolution has had a stunning year on the share market with its stock up 166 per cent since January. It has been a transformative year with the purchase of the Cowal mine from Barrick Gold and a combination with Egyptian controlled group La Mancha, which owns 31 per cent of the company. The company's market capitalisation has risen from $300 million to $1.6 billion. Several analysts have a ""buy"" rating on Evolution shares based on analysis using the net present value of future cashflows.

It has been a game changing year for Evolution, which is now Australia's second largest gold producer. If the company can deliver what Klein is promising it will be the new star of the local gold mining market. The decision by Labor Senator Sam Dastyari to heartily endorse a credit card switching campaign that will deliver significant commercial benefits to News Corp and Seven West Media looks a little strange to say the least. Dastyari has thrown his weight behind the One Big Debt Switch campaign being run in the News Corp papers and on Channel Seven by a company called One Big Switch Pty Ltd One Big Switch was founded by former adviser to Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, Lachlan Harris. The company is partly owned by News Corp. The endorsement of the campaign is strange for two reasons. Dastyari is supposed to be conducting an independent inquiry into the credit card market. His public statements have indicated he wants to encourage increased competition including the use of peer to peer lending. But the One Big Debt Switch campaign does not offer any dramatic market changing solutions. It is simply imposing itself between card issuers and consumers in order to boost the profits of the company in the middle clipping the ticket. While the One Big Debt Switch is dressed up as a campaign for helping consumers to save money, the reality is it will just be reheating the existing credit card offerings. Submissions to Dastyari's inquiry by the big banks include data showing that Australians are already aware that there are a range of competitive cards offering different interest rates and features. Westpac's submission said consumers can currently choose from more than 80 credit card providers from banks, credit unions and non-bank institutions offering more than 250 different products. Consumers are already voting with their feet in order to get a better deal. The Commonwealth Bank of Australia submission to the inquiry says that its low rate card which carries an interest rate of 13.49 per cent is now the bank's most popular credit card. It comprises more than 42 per cent of new applications, compared to around 33 per cent in 2011. Existing customers on CBA Awards and CBA low fee cards have transferred more than $1 billion in balances to low rate cards since July 1, 2011. Chanticleer suspects that one of the best pieces of advice that Dastyari's inquiry could offer credit card users will be in relation to lifting Australia's standards of education in relation to financial literacy. That means teaching children and less well informed adults about the dangers of using credit cards for revolving unsecured borrowing, the availability of competitive products in the credit card market and the emerging unsecured lending alternatives thanks to disruptive fintech technologies such as peer to peer lending. If Dastyari wants to encourage independent, well informed thinking by consumers he might want to point them in the direction of all the intermediaries offering comparison services including Mozo, InfoChoice and Cannex rather than favouring one provider. The privatisation of the registry business currently run by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission presents a perfect opportunity to remove red tape and make Australia a more attractive place to do business. But the early indications from the federal government are not positive. It is possible that the privatisation of the ASIC registry will be used as an opportunity to maximise the amount of money raised for debt reduction without passing on any benefits to business. An inquiry last year into the performance of ASIC recommended that the introduction of a user-pays model for funding ASIC should be used as an opportunity to reduce the fees prescribed for chargeable matters under the Corporations (Fees) Act 2001 with a view to bringing the fees charged in Australia in line with the fees charged in other jurisdictions. That recommendation could go by the wayside. In order to maximise the sale proceeds it is possible the government will simply add the $260 million in cost recovery fees on top of the existing revenues of $680 million. That explains why the estimates for the value of the ASIC registry business range so widely. In other countries, there is no cost for searching information about registered companies. Also, it is much cheaper to register a company. Research conducted by Nathan Lynch, a regulatory analyst with Thomson Reuters, has shown that about 80 per cent of the fees charged by ASIC's registry are paid by small business.  Rod Sims, chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is right on top of the issues thrown up by privatisation and the incentives for governments to structure their privatisation processes in a manner that maximises the sale price they receive. In a speech being delivered to Infrastructure Partnerships Australia on Friday, Sims will say that the incentive to maximise sale prices can sometimes result an effective 'tax' on future generations. He says in the longer term, a less competitive market structure will lead to higher priced and lower quality goods and services for consumers. Sims is also concerned about ""the selling of monopoly or near monopoly assets without appropriate access and/or pricing controls, such as Part IIIA undertakings or robust State or Territory access regimes."
1196,"In mid-August, Burlington-based solar monitoring company Draker said it was downsizing and the Pine Street offices emptied. Now, Draker has issued a statement saying it is being bought by another leading solar company that will service Draker’s current clients and address a backlog of new orders.

Draker and the unidentified business expect to close their deal this month. In the meantime, Draker said the company buying it will immediately resume service and support on the solar monitoring systems already in place.

“The agreement provides for the acquisition of the Draker business, creating what is expected to become the world’s leading independent data solutions provider,” the release from Draker continues.

Draker also said it would immediately recall key staff that were laid off last month. The company’s offices in Burlington appear to have been empty for the past two weeks.

Everett McGinley, executive chairman, said in a statement that despite rumors circulating in industry press, Draker has delivered uninterrupted monitoring services to all of its clients during a period of “uncertainty” following the early break-off of merger talks.

Greentech Media, a business-to-business website that covers the solar industry with offices in Boston, San Francisco and New York, reported Friday that, “Sources indicate that most or all of the company’s employees were let go. Other sources suggest that Draker has left customers without monitoring capabilities and scrambling for a replacement.”

Draker makes systems that monitor the output of utility-scale solar installations around the world.

“The software tells people how well their arrays are performing,” said Julie Haugh, Draker’s former chief software engineer in Austin, Texas. “It also tells them if a piece of the system is not working correctly, or clearly broken, so maintenance people can be sent out to do things like replace broken solar panels or fix broken hardware.”

Haugh told the Free Press Draker’s products continue to be used on thousands of large solar power plants that provide hundreds of megawatts to the grid throughout North America. Draker maintained a small office in Austin after it merged with Solar Power Technologies, Inc., in 2012.

Haugh, 53, was laid off on Aug. 14 along with the remaining Draker employees in Austin, she said.

Haugh said she would love to remain in the solar industry, and that she hopes to return to a resurgent Draker, but that the solar power industry is going through growing pains.

“The entire solar industry is going through consolidation, the same as computers in the 1980s,” Haugh said. “My expectation is the consolidation will continue for a number of years until a clear market leader has emerged.”

Before its current problems, Draker was that market leader, according to its own news releases. In 2012, the company cited record growth the previous year, saying 2011 was the second year of more than 250 percent revenue growth.

In 2014, Draker issued a news release saying GTM Research, a division of Greentech Media, named Draker as the fastest growing independent solar monitoring provider in the United States for the second year in a row. GTM Research also ranked Draker as the Number 1 independent monitoring software provider in the U.S. industrial solar market."
2051,"Networking firm Ubiquiti Networks Inc. disclosed this week that cyber thieves recently stole $46.7 million using an increasingly common scam in which crooks spoof communications from executives at the victim firm in a bid to initiate unauthorized international wire transfers.

Ubiquiti, a San Jose based maker of networking technology for service providers and enterprises, disclosed the attack in a quarterly financial report filed this week with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The company said it discovered the fraud on June 5, 2015, and that the incident involved employee impersonation and fraudulent requests from an outside entity targeting the company’s finance department.

“This fraud resulted in transfers of funds aggregating $46.7 million held by a Company subsidiary incorporated in Hong Kong to other overseas accounts held by third parties,” Ubiquiti wrote. “As soon as the Company became aware of this fraudulent activity it initiated contact with its Hong Kong subsidiary’s bank and promptly initiated legal proceedings in various foreign jurisdictions. As a result of these efforts, the Company has recovered $8.1 million of the amounts transferred.”

Known variously as “CEO fraud,” and the “business email compromise,” the swindle that hit Ubiquiti is a sophisticated and increasingly common one targeting businesses working with foreign suppliers and/or businesses that regularly perform wire transfer payments.  In January 2015, the FBI warned that cyber thieves stole nearly $215 million from businesses in the previous 14 months through such scams, which start when crooks spoof or hijack the email accounts of business executives or employees.

In February, con artists made off with $17.2 million from one of Omaha, Nebraska’s oldest companies —  The Scoular Co., an employee-owned commodities trader. According to Omaha.com, an executive with the 800-employee company wired the money in installments last summer to a bank in China after receiving emails ordering him to do so.

In March 2015, I posted the story Spoofing the Boss Turns Thieves a Tidy Profit, which recounted the nightmarish experience of an Ohio manufacturing firm that came within a whisker of losing $315,000 after an employee received an email she thought was from her boss asking her to wire the money to China to pay for some raw materials.

Ubiquiti didn’t disclose precisely how it was scammed, but CEO fraud usually begins with the thieves either phishing an executive and gaining access to that individual’s inbox, or emailing employees from a look-alike domain name that is one or two letters off from the target company’s true domain name. For example, if the target company’s domain was “example.com” the thieves might register “examp1e.com” (substituting the letter “L” for the numeral 1) or “example.co,” and send messages from that domain.

In these cases, the fraudsters will forge the sender’s email address displayed to the recipient, so that the email appears to be coming from example.com. In all cases, however, the “reply-to” address is the spoofed domain (e.g. examp1e.com), ensuring that any replies are sent to the fraudster.

In the case of the above-mentioned Ohio manufacturing firm that nearly lost $315,000, that company determined that the fraudsters had just hours before the attack registered the phony domain and associated email account with Vistaprint, which offers a free one-month trial for companies looking to quickly set up a Web site.

Ubiquiti said in addition to the $8.1 million it already recovered, some $6.8 million of the amounts transferred are currently subject to legal injunction and reasonably expected to be recovered. It added that an internal investigation completed last month uncovered no evidence that its systems were penetrated or that any corporate information, including our financial and account information, was accessed. Likewise, the investigation reported no evidence of employee criminal involvement in the fraud.

“The Company is continuing to pursue the recovery of the remaining $31.8 million and is cooperating with U.S. federal and numerous overseas law enforcement authorities who are actively pursuing a multi-agency criminal investigation,” the 10-K filing reads. “The Company may be limited in what information it can disclose due to the ongoing investigation. The Company currently believes this is an isolated event and does not believe its technology systems have been compromised or that Company data has been exposed.”

The FBI’s advisory on these scams urges businesses to adopt two-step or two-factor authentication for email, where available, and/or to establish other communication channels — such as telephone calls — to verify significant transactions. Businesses are also advised to exercise restraint when publishing information about employee activities on their Web sites or through social media, as attackers perpetrating these schemes often will try to discover information about when executives at the targeted organization will be traveling or otherwise out of the office.

Ubiquiti noted that as a result of its investigation, the company and its audit committee and advisors concluded that its internal control over financial reporting were ineffective due to one or more material weaknesses, though it didn’t disclose what measures it took to close those security gaps.

“The Company has implemented enhanced internal controls over financial reporting since June 5, 2015 and is in the process of implementing additional procedures and controls pursuant to recommendations from the investigation,” it said.

There are probably some scenarios in which legitimate emails between two parties carry different display and “reply-to” addresses. But if the message also involves a “reply-to” domain that has virtually no reputation (it was registered within hours or days of the message being sent), the chances that the email is fraudulent go up dramatically.

Unlike traditional phishing scams, spoofed emails used in CEO fraud schemes are unlikely to set off spam traps, because these are targeted phishing scams that are not mass e-mailed. Also, the crooks behind them take the time to understand the target organization’s relationships, activities, interests and travel and/or purchasing plans.

They do this by scraping employee email addresses and other information from the target’s Web site to help make the missives more convincing. In the case where executives or employees have their inboxes compromised by the thieves, the crooks will scour the victim’s email correspondence for certain words that might reveal whether the company routinely deals with wire transfers — searching for messages with key words like “invoice,” “deposit” and “president.”

On the surface, business email compromise scams may seem unsophisticated relative to moneymaking schemes that involve complex malicious software, such as Dyre and ZeuS. But in many ways, the BEC attack is more versatile and adept at sidestepping basic security strategies used by banks and their customers to minimize risks associated with account takeovers. In traditional phishing scams, the attackers interact with the victim’s bank directly, but in the BEC scam the crooks trick the victim into doing that for them.

Hat tip to Brian Honan at CSO Online, who spotted this filing on Thursday. Update, 4:20 ET: Corrected the spelling in several instances of the networking company’s name.

695,"The furious pace of buying and selling homes showed no signs of slowing last month in Colorado Springs and surrounding communities, according to a new report from the Pikes Peak Association of Realtors.

""What is happening for sure is the market is strong,"" Charles D'Allesio, a real estate agent with Synergy Realty Group in the Springs, said Thursday.

A look at the latest Realtors Association report shows:

- Monthly sales: Single-family home sales totaled 1,383 in August, a nearly one-quarter increase over the same month a year ago. While that's short of a record, last month's sales were the most for any August since at least 1993. Sales now have increased for 13 straight months on a year-over-year basis.

- Annual sales: Through the first eight months of 2015, home sales totaled 9,034, up nearly 20 percent over the same period last year. This year's sales already have exceeded the annual totals for each year from 2008 through 2011.

- Prices: The median price - or mid-point - of all home sales in August rose to $241,468, a 5 percent increase over the same month a year ago. Median prices now have risen for nine consecutive months and 15 out of the last 16. Since the recession ended, and over the last five years, values have increased significantly, D'Allesio said. Still, he said, sellers must be realistic; they can't ask for ""a ridiculous price"" and expect to get it. That's a turn-off for some buyers, who aren't going to pay too much, he said.

- Market drivers: Affordable borrowing costs continue to fuel buying. Thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgages averaged 3.89 percent nationally this week, according to a report Thursday by mortgage buyer Freddie Mac. Long-term rates generally have hovered around the 4 percent mark throughout 2015.

Other factors driving homebuying include a better local economy and improved consumer confidence, real estate industry members have said.

- Nagging problem: The inventory of homes listed for sale totaled 3,378 in August, down almost 18 percent from the same month in 2014. At the same time, the rental market for single-family homes is ""super hot,"" D'Allesio said.

The result: A tight supply of homes for sale in the entry-level market, D'Allesio said.

""You can still find some good homes over $300,000; there's still a good amount of inventory there,"" he said. ""But anything below $300,000? It is selling fast...We have a lot of buyers in that $150,000 to $225,000 price range, and there's no inventory.""

- Fourth-quarter outlook: D'Allesio expects continued strong buying and selling for the rest of the year. However, the inventory shortage won't necessarily get better. Also, he said, buyers and sellers should be aware that federally mandated changes in mortgage lending rules, which take effect Oct. 3, could lengthen the time it takes to complete home sales, he said."
231,"NEW DELHI: Bulk of the impact of Seventh Pay Commission, under which salaries of government employees will be reviewed, is likely to be absorbed by the Budget of the next financial year, 2016-17, says a DBS report.The global financial services major said pay/allowances could rise by 16 per cent following the rollout of the Seventh Pay Commission.""If adopted, bulk of the impact (of the Seventh Pay Commission) will be absorbed by the FY16/17 Budget,"" the DBS report said adding that ""historically, the pay commission's rollout has been negative for fiscal balances.""As per DBS, the increase in bonus payments and pay/ allowances would cumulatively imply a first-round increase in spending to the tune of 0.2-0.3 per cent of GDP in FY16/17, ""putting deficit targets at risk"".""These higher spending needs will require the government to either re-channel fiscal savings, restrain spending elsewhere or renege on the fiscal deficit targets,"" it added.The Seventh Pay Commission, set up by the government to revise remuneration of about 48 lakh central government employees and 55 lakh pensioners, will submit its report by December 31.DBS said that the full impact would get clearer when the pay commission tables its recommendations later this year.The recommendations of the Seventh Pay Commission are scheduled to come into effect from January 1, 2016.The previous Sixth Pay Commission was rolled out in the third quarter of 2008, at a time when the economy was reeling under the impact of the global financial crisis.""Implementation of the revised salaries/ pensions (plus arrears), along with farm loan waivers and other stimulus measures saw the fiscal deficit balloon from -2.5 per cent of GDP in FY07/08 to -6.0 per cent in FY08/09 and stay high for another year before easing off,"" the report added.The government constitutes the Pay Commission almost every 10 years to revise the pay scale of its employees and often these are adopted by states after some modifications."
1459,"An early rally after Tuesday’s plunge has fizzled out, with the UK’s leading index slipping into negative territory again.

There were a few bright spots in the falling FTSE 100 (unlike on Tuesday when only engineer Meggitt managed to make any gains as global markets including Wall Street tumbled).

Equipment hire group Ashtead has added 45p to 962p after it reported a 20% rise in first quarter revenue to £539.6m and said it was on track to reach its full year target. In a buy note, Investec said:

Hikma was 99p higher at £23.24 after a positive note from Barclays in the wake of the pharmaceutical group’s $2.65bn purchase of the generics drug division of US business Boehringer Ingleheim. The bank said:

At a point when the market was fixated on [key product] colchicine, and unfounded claims that growth was over-reliant on shortage situations, Hikma has transformed its US exposure and long-term visibility through the $2.65bn acquisition of Roxane. Boosting outer year earnings by more than 20%, the deal revolutionises future opportunities... It marks the second transaction between Hikma and Boehringer so begs the question what is next, and with a major influx of R&D personnel the long term growth profile is significantly de-risked. We raise our price target to £27.60 [from £20.50] on the relatively de-risked investment case. With Boehringer owning around 17% of Hikma [it] could benefit from further expansion of the relationship via: i) becoming Boehringer’s future authorized generic partner, ii) distributing Boehringer products in the Middle East and North Africa, and iii) potential future biosimilar collaboration.

Meanwhile chip designer Arm is up 16.5p to 930p as JP Morgan Cazenove moved from underweight to neutral.

Tesco has edged up 0.05p to 185.45p on reports it has picked private equity firm MBK Partners as the preferred bidder for its South Korean business.

But overall the FTSE 100 is faltering again, down 16.10 points at 6042.44, ahead of US jobs data later which could give further clues as to the timing of a Federal Reserve rate rise. More significantly, Friday sees the US non-farm payroll numbers, which have the potential to cause more volatility. Meanwhile Chinese markets are closed until Monday due to celebrations to mark Japan’s defeat in World War II.

Commodity companies were under pressure again as the fears of a slowdown in China hit metal and oil prices. Brent crude is currently down another 1.69% at $48.72.

Royal Dutch Shell B shares are down 30p at £16.16 while BP is 4.8p lower at 344.6p.

Among the miners Glencore continues to decline, down another 6.55p at 126.95p on financing concerns.

Asia focused HSBC is down 6.55p at 492.45p and Standard Chartered is 10p lower at 714.2p on contining concerns about emerging markets.

What does this latest development in CR disclosure requirements mean for you?

In October 2014, the EU issued its directive on corporate disclosure of non-financial and diversity information by larger companies. In essence, this requires many companies headquartered or having significant operations in the EU to disclose non-financial data (e.g., environmental, social, and governance-related information) on a regular basis.

These companies are now trying to figure out what this directive legally requires from them, and the competitive pressures they may subsequently experience in their industries. While the legislation provides for a two-year transition period, EU member states will ultimately be required to put corresponding legislation in place in late 2016 to regulate reporting starting with business year 2017. There are many opinions about this directive and the resulting legislation that it will require. These include a concern that the EU has placed an undue burden on affected companies, and that significant red tape and financial outlay will be required. In our assessment, both these opinions are misplaced.

The Next Higher Bar in CR Reporting?

Expectations regarding corporate responsibility (CR) and/or sustainability — basically interchangeable terms in business today — have been steadily increasing over the last few years. With regard to CR reporting, in the early 2000s early movers were situated at the margins of mainstream industry or economies. Starting in 2007, state-owned companies in Sweden were legally required to publish sustainability reports according to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) framework. In 2010, the Johannesburg Stock Exchange introduced the requirement that South African companies listed on the exchange had to publish Integrated Reports that combined financial and non-financial information. Since then, sustainability or CR reporting has become commonplace, and even an expected part of business, for many companies.

One example of this shifting expectation is the Sustainable Stock Exchanges (SSE) initiative that explores the roles that stock exchanges can play in enhancing corporate transparency on environmental, social and corporate governance-related issues. Another is the Singapore Exchange, which announced in 2014 that it will step up their previously voluntary encouragement on sustainability reporting to a mandatory requirement for listed companies. Following a year-long consultation process, the exchange will publish specific guidelines in late 2015 and expect compliance starting 2017, the same year that the EU Directive will be fully implemented in national law. These examples illustrate that the EU Directive is a logical next step in a larger global regulatory development. It is thus unlikely to fizzle away during implementation — although it will likely be watered down to different degrees in the various EU member states.

What Does the EU Directive Build On, and What Does It Intend?

The EU Directive on the disclosure of non-financial and diversity information is closely linked to regulations regarding financial disclosures. In fact, it amends an earlier directive that regulates corporate annual financial statements, consolidated financial statements, and related reports. That earlier directive required companies to publish management reports that present a balanced and comprehensive analysis of the organization’s business and market position and specified that information on both financial and non-financial performance (such as environmental and employee matters) should be included “to the extent necessary.” The EU Directive now clearly spells out how that is to be done.

In the EU Directive the management report is specified as the default part of corporate reporting where the non-financial statement should be included. However, it also allows companies to issue the non-financial statement as a separate report if it covers the same financial year as the management report. The directive also requires that the statutory auditor or audit firm verify whether the non-financial statement has been provided.

While additional EU Commission guidelines on methodology and non-financial key performance indicators are still forthcoming, the EU Directive mentions a number of issues to consider for inclusion. While these suggestions are couched in terms such as should, may, or could, they give an indication of which kinds of disclosures may ultimately be required.

How Will the EU Directive be Implemented on the Ground?

With the directive, the EU has expressed a clear expectation for increased CR disclosure in Europe. The qualification that non-financial disclosures will be required only from larger companies of “public interest” (currently defined as exchange-listed companies, credit institutions; and insurance companies, with others to be included at the discretion of member state governments) reflects previous controversial debates about avoiding red tape, and clearly takes SME’s with less than 500 employees (or lower than ~$50 million in revenue) off the table. And the choice of a directive as the instrument means that — unlike for an EU regulation that would have been immediately in force across the union — there is leeway for the member states in how they implement or “transpose” this requirement into national legislation. The directive spells out a required result to be reached in a certain timeframe, but leaves the exact means up to the member states. The expectation is that they will keep the needs of their business community in mind and implement national requirements in a manner that avoids excessive burden.

The concrete nature of the required disclosures will become clearer once national implementation has been drafted in 2016. However, the directive already specifies that companies may rely on ISO 26000 or on the guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) in addition to a number of EU, UN, ILO, and OECD frameworks. It also mentions that national frameworks can provide guidance, and proponents of national initiatives like the German Sustainability Codex (DNK) are already advocating for the use of their frameworks. In addition, the EU Commission has been asked to prepare non-binding guidelines for implementation, including suggesting non-financial key performance indicators for consideration.

Impact on Companies Outside the EU?

Once implemented in national law, the directive will directly impact EU-based companies that have over 500 employees and are “public-interest companies.” This term is defined elsewhere in EU guidelines as companies that are stock exchange listed, are credit institutions (banks) or insurance companies, or have been determined to be of public interest by the respective member state. Following the publication of the directive, it was estimated early on that around 6,000 companies in the EU would be directly affected once national regulations are in place in late 2016.

In the meantime, Denmark has already become the first European country transposing the directive by amending the Danish Financial Statements Act in May 2015. Following reporting requirements for a smaller set of large stock–listed and state-owned companies effective 2016, full implementation of the Danish regulations effective 2018 will require all large companies in Denmark — more than 1,000 companies overall — to comply. This illustrates that across the EU, the number of companies ultimately affected may be much higher than initially expected. Beyond that, if those companies required to report start asking their suppliers to provide them CR information for their reports, all companies doing business with them will feel the pressure of increasing CR disclosure expectations as well.

Similar to EU-based companies, businesses headquartered in countries that are not in the EU but are members of the European Economic Area (EEA) — Liechtenstein, Norway, and Iceland — will be impacted by incorporation of the directive into the Annexes or Protocols of the EEA Agreement. Such amendments are required for EU acts that are EEA relevant, which has been determined to be the case for the present EU Directive.

However, an even larger group of companies that are not headquartered in the EU will be impacted by mandatory reporting requirements: the non-EU headquartered corporations that do business in EU member states via local subsidiaries that fall under the directive’s requirements. The directive specifies that subsidiary undertakings shall be exempt from mandatory reporting if they are covered in a consolidated non-financial statement of their parent group that meets the directive’s requirements. Many corporate group and holding companies will likely elect to publish a non-financial report that meets the EU requirements, probably at the strictest directive implementation level from within those member states where they do business, rather than invest in having each of their subsidiaries do their own reporting.

What Are Your Options?

If your company or its subsidiaries are likely to be affected by mandatory non-financial requirements under the EU Directive, you have several options to consider:

1) You may decide to do nothing for now and observe how the directive is ultimately implemented into national law. You may also decide to conduct a minimal CR monitoring and reporting effort — if you are not already doing so — to get your feet wet with regard to CR topics. This can include a simple prioritization exercise (materiality assessment) and basic disclosures of data and CR achievements. Both options have the upside of avoiding significant investment. The downside is that once reporting is required of your company, setting up the systems and processes can become a fire drill that is much more costly than building your CR infrastructure step by step with enough time to find the most meaningful option.

2) If you are willing and able to start laying more robust foundations for CR reporting and activities at this point in time, you may consider implementing an established CR framework for your monitoring and reporting efforts like the one provided by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) reporting guidelines. This requires a more substantial prioritization or materiality exercise, which should include at least some external stakeholder participation or validation, as well as monitoring and disclosure of performance information according to standard indicator protocols. The choice of, for example, “core” or “comprehensive” GRI guideline implementation depends on the amount of data available at your company with reasonable effort, and on the appetite of top management to disclose corporate policies, including those related to governance and compensation. If you are doing this for the first time, or if you are upgrading from the previous G3 to the current G4 version of GRI reporting, this requires a certain level of investment. The benefit is that you can demonstrate your commitment to CR clearly and credibly, and not only be well prepared for impacts of the EU Directive but also reap the benefits in marketing, customer relations (including supply chain questionnaires), and investor relations.

3) If you want to be an acknowledged leader on CR, and have the means and commitment, you have a number of interesting options to consider. You can expand your prioritization or materiality exercise into a comprehensive, participative dialogue that supports cultural change and engages customers, investors, and other external stakeholders in building trusted, lasting relationships. And you can use the content generated in more traditional non-financial or integrated reporting formats for social media and similar dialogue initiatives with the groups that ultimately determine your business success.

433,"Oil climbed after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi vowed to use all tools within his mandate to support economic recovery.

Futures climbed 1.1 percent in New York, extending Wednesday’s 1.9 percent gain amid speculation that further stimulus will bolster European fuel demand. Crude gains eased and equities retreated from their highs as attention turned later in the day to how payrolls data will influence the timing and pace of Federal Reserve interest-rate increases.

Oil has fluctuated this week after capping the biggest three-day rally in 25 years on Monday. Futures dropped earlier as President Barack Obama secured congressional support for the Iranian nuclear deal and U.S. crude supplies increased the most since April, signaling a global glut will persist.

""We’re tracking what’s happening with the equity market and dollar today,"" Stephen Schork, president of the Schork Group Inc. in Villanova, Pennsylvania, said by phone. ""It’s hard too get too excited about oil itself, because the fundamentals are very bearish.""

West Texas Intermediate oil for October delivery rose 50 cents to settle at $46.75 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract touched $37.75 on Aug. 24, the lowest level since February 2009. Prices are down 12 percent this year.

Brent for October settlement increased 18 cents to end the session at $50.68 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The North Sea crude touched $42.23 on Aug. 24, the least since 2009. The European benchmark closed at a $3.93 premium to WTI.

The Chicago Board Options Exchange Crude Oil Volatility Index climbed to the highest level since March 17 on Tuesday. The gauge tracks hedging costs on the U.S. Oil Fund, the biggest exchange-traded fund tracking WTI.

""Volatility is still the dominant theme,"" Gene McGillian, a senior analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut, said by phone. ""The big question right now is whether we have put in the bottoms of around $38 for WTI and $42 for Brent. I’m doubtful.""

Saudi Arabia cut pricing for all October oil sales to the U.S. as refinery demand falls with the end of the summer driving season on the Sept. 7 Labor Day holiday. State-owned Saudi Arabian Oil Co. cut its selling price for October Arab Medium sales to U.S. buyers by 50 cents a barrel, to 55 cents less than a regional benchmark, widening the discount for the first time in eight months, the company said in an e-mailed statement Thursday.

""I wonder how real much of this trading is because a lot of people are already off ahead of Labor Day,"" Bill O’Grady, chief market strategist at Confluence Investment Management in St. Louis, which oversees $3.4 billion, said by phone. ""We’re in a trading range and there’s a lot of movement up and down, but we’re not in any new territory.""

Crude futures slipped to six-year lows after China’s Aug. 11 devaluation of its currency roiled global financial markets, sparking concern that slowing growth there may spread. The Chinese exchanges are closed for a holiday Thursday, giving investors a respite from market moves there.

""The lack of bad news from China is helping the market,"" McGillian said."

611,"It's jobs day in America, and this particularly monthly jobs report has taken on increased importance.

With the continued uncertainty in the stock market, a good report could have significant impact on the Fed's decision whether or not to raise interest rates in September. A rate hike would be the first hike since June 2006.

The only problem, August is historically a terrible month for this report. According to economist Joseph LaVorgna at Deutsche Bank, the August nonfarm payroll numbers have a history of seriously disappointing expectations.

""Since 1988, when our sample begins, August nonfarm payrolls have disappointed the financial markets in 21 out of 27 years, or 78% of the time,"" said LaVorgna in a note to clients.

The consensus estimate among economists sits at 218,000 new jobs added in the month of August, but the consensus has had some big misses in the past says LaVorgna.

""The average forecast error has been -61k. The range of misses, though, has been large. The median forecast error has been -42k,"" he writes.

In 2014, August estimates heading into the report estimated a gain of 230,000 jobs. The labor market whiffed, adding just 142,000 jobs. In fact, August has failed to meet the consensus expectation every year since 2010.

LaVorgna says that the labor market can experience weak spots, much like in March when nonfarm payrolls added was only 126,000 against 245,000 expected. According to the note, this was eventually revised down to an even weaker 119,000.

""If we conservatively use the median forecast error, rather than the average, we are looking at August nonfarm payrolls of 170k,"" he wrote. ""By itself, this number should be strong enough to keep the Fed on track for September liftoff.""

LaVorgna's not alone in his recognition that August usually stinks and in his assessment that a disappointing jobs report doesn't rule out a September rate hike.

""August is a notoriously fluky month, subject to enormous upward revisions,"" Potomac Research Group's Greg Valliere wrote on Thursday. ""Job growth has averaged only about 100,000 in the past four Augusts, several economists have pointed out this week. So the 220,000 target for tomorrow may be unattainable; 180,000 or so may be sufficient for the Fed to lift off on Sept. 17.""

People listen to Valliere on such matters because his staff at Potomac Research Group includes former Fed Vice Chair Donald Kohn.

""However, we are concerned that if August payrolls disappoint, market expectations for September liftoff could fall even further given a dovish-leaning Fed that has consistently been hesitant to raise interest rates, even gingerly, off an emergency level that has been in place since December 2008,"" LaVorgna said.

Shifting expectations for the timing of tighter monetary policy could aggravate volatility in the markets."
2028,"Defense lawyers for three former Dewey & LeBoeuf LLP leaders accused of committing financial fraud failed get the case tossed out Tuesday, as a judge ruled there was enough evidence to send the matter to a jury for deliberation.

New York state court Judge Robert Stolz did reserve the right to dismiss some of the 100 counts against the trio—Dewey’s former chairman, Steven Davis, ex-chief financial officer, Joel Sanders, and former executive director, Stephen DiCarmine—before sending it to the jury.

Assistant District Attorney Steve Pilnyak argued in court Tuesday that prosecutors have laid out enough evidence over 3 months, through 41 witnesses, to prove the ex-Dewey leaders oversaw a scheme to manipulate the fallen law firm’s books in the years leading up to its 2012 bankruptcy.

Mr. Pilnyak argued that Mr. Davis, as head of the firm, knew improper accounting adjustments were being made by lower-level employees, but distanced himself from the action the way a drug king pin talks in “code” when overseeing a drug conspiracy.

The bulk of the prosecution’s case relied on testimony from seven Dewey employees who have pleaded guilty to related crimes and told the jury about the faulty accounting adjustments they say they helped implement.

Once Mr. Sanders “got marching orders,” from the other two defendants, Mr. Pilnyak said, he “would get one of the cooperators to do the dirty work.”

Mr. Davis’s lawyer, Elkan Abramowitz, said in response that “there is not one piece of evidence that Mr. Davis directed anybody to do anything improper.”

In an email exchange read in court that prosecutors say shows Mr. DiCarmine helped implement the scheme, Mr. Sanders asked Mr. DiCarmine in January 2010 about paying a bonus to the firm’s finance director, Frank Canellas, who is one of the seven cooperators. “I’m pushing him to go way out on a limb right behind me, if you know what I mean,” Mr. Sanders wrote. “That’s fine, do it,” Mr. DiCarmine replied.

Mr. DiCarmine’s lawyer said the email was meant to imply that Mr. Canellas was worried about the ability to support his family, knowing the firm was in a shaky financial state.

The defense has long insisted that accounting adjustments aren’t necessarily improper and are part of balancing a firm’s books. Last week, Mr. Sanders’s lawyer argued in a letter to the court that the case should be dismissed because the prosecution didn’t call a single expert witness to explain to the jury what makes the adjustments illegal.

Prosecutors claim the financial manipulation was used to hide Dewey’s flagging financial state from banks and investors that loaned $250 million to the firm."
1539,"The air around the sprawling General Electric research facility near the Mohawk River has gotten cleaner since boilers there are running mainly on natural gas, rather than the most-polluting form of fuel oil.

Under a proposed state air pollution permit, the GE Global Research Center will be required to burn more natural gas and less No. 6 fuel oil, which is also called bunker oil.

Combustion of that type of oil releases much higher levels of soot, sulfur dioxide (which causes acid rain) and nitrogen oxide, which contributes to the formation of smog. Smog can worsen breathing issues for people with asthma and other respiratory ailments.

GE spokesman Todd Alhart said the fuel changeover in Niskayuna has already been done. ""We use both fuels, but we are burning more natural gas now and that is the majority of our fuel,"" he said.

Switching from bunker oil to natural gas reduces soot emissions by 96 percent, sulfur dioxide by 99 percent, and NOx by about 75 percent, according to figures from the Natural Resources Defense Council.

In Niskayuna, the draft air pollution permit for the plant also reflects new federal limits for nitrogen oxide, which were adopted in 2012, and will also require GE to test boilers at Niskayuna to ""determine actual NOx emission rates.""

GE has been burning more natural gas because the price of the fuel has declined considerably, making it cheaper than fuel oil, according to DEC.

Natural gas prices have fallen because of a glut caused by natural gas hydrofracking in neighboring Pennsylvania and other states."

279,"HIGH POINT, N.C., Sep 02, 2015 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Culp, Inc. CFI, +3.70% today reported financial and operating results for the first quarter ended August 2, 2015.

For the first quarter ended August 2, 2015, net sales were $80.2 million, compared with $76.1 million a year ago. The company reported net income of $4.7 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, for the first quarter of fiscal 2016, compared with net income of $3.3 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, for the first quarter of fiscal 2015. The first quarter of fiscal 2016 had 13 weeks compared with 14 weeks for the first quarter of fiscal 2015.

Given the volatility in the income tax area during fiscal 2015 and previous years, the company is also reporting adjusted net income (non-GAAP), which is calculated using estimated cash income tax expense for its foreign subsidiaries. (A presentation of adjusted net income and reconciliation to net income is set forth on page 6). The company currently does not incur cash income tax expense in the U.S., nor does it expect to for a few more years, due to approximately $32 million in U.S. net operating loss carryforwards as of the end of fiscal 2015. For the first quarter of fiscal 2016, adjusted net income was $6.2 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, compared with $4.5 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, for the first quarter of fiscal 2015. On a pre-tax basis, the company reported income of $7.4 million compared with $5.5 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2015.

Commenting on the results, Frank Saxon, president and chief executive officer of Culp, Inc., said, “We are pleased to report a solid start to fiscal 2016, with our first quarter sales and operating results better than expected, driven by strong performances in both of our businesses. Overall, our total sales were up 5.4 percent compared with a year ago. These results reflect favorable demand trends and positive customer response to our creative designs and diverse product offering. Our strategic focus on innovation and product excellence continues to be the key driver of our performance in both businesses, and we intend to follow this same strategy in fiscal 2016. Importantly, we have a scalable and global manufacturing platform that supports our ability to deliver these products and meet changing customer demand with exceptional service. We also have the financial strength to continue making the strategic investments to support our growth. Finally, we are especially pleased that Culp is now debt-free for the first time in our 43-year history.”

Mattress fabrics sales for the first quarter were $47.8 million, up 11.6 percent compared with $42.8 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2015.

“Our mattress fabrics business continued to gain momentum in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 with better than expected results,” said Iv Culp, president of Culp’s mattress fabrics division. “The higher sales for the quarter reflect favorable demand trends through the busy summer selling season. Importantly, we continued to outpace overall industry growth as our outstanding designs and innovative product offering provide a strong competitive advantage in today’s mattress fabric marketplace. From design to final delivery, we are doing an exceptional job in executing our vision to offer a full complement of fabrics and sewn covers across all price points and style trends, backed by excellent service. Our products are resonating with customers who are embracing today’s more fashionable and decorative look, and we are well positioned to capitalize on these demand trends and expand our sales. Culp has a strong value proposition that combines outstanding design capabilities with an expanded manufacturing platform focused on mirrored manufacturing and reactive capacity.

“Our improved operating results reflect solid execution of the strategic plan that we laid out at the beginning of last fiscal year, with consistent growth and progress since we began our $9.5 million capital project. We are realizing the benefits of this expanded capacity and new equipment with greater operating efficiencies, enhanced finishing capabilities and better overall throughput. Additionally, we benefited from some lower input costs during the quarter.

“We have completed the major work at our two North Carolina facilities, and we are now focused on expanding our operations and installing additional new equipment in our Canadian location during fiscal 2016. Through our continued capital investments, we remain dedicated to our product delivery performance and strive to offer the best possible service to our customers.

“Overall, the fundamentals of our mattress fabrics business are strong, and we have created a strategic infrastructure that will support our continued growth and innovation. We are also pleased with the increasing contribution from our latest venture in sewn mattress covers, which further supports our diversification strategy and enhances our strong value proposition. We remain confident in our ability to execute our strategy with continued success in the year ahead,” Culp concluded.

Sales for this segment were $32.4 million for the first quarter, compared with sales of $33.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2015.

“Our upholstery fabrics sales were in line with our expectations for the first quarter of fiscal 2016, while our operating results improved significantly,” noted Boyd Chumbley, executive vice president of Culp’s upholstery fabrics division. “Overall, we are pleased with our consistent execution of a product-driven strategy with a focus on creative designs and product innovation. We have also pursued marketing strategies to diversify our customer base and expand our geographic reach. Together, these efforts have been the key drivers of our sales and operating performance, both with existing customers and new customers. We have continued to enhance our product mix with favorable results, and we are pleased with our recent success in reaching additional end-user markets, including increased sales with the hospitality and “lifestyle” retail markets.

“Our global platform supports these marketing efforts with the flexibility to adapt to changing furniture market trends and consumer style preferences. China produced fabrics accounted for 93 percent of Culp’s upholstery fabrics sales during the first quarter. This unique platform has allowed us to more effectively reach new customers, with the ability to offer a diverse product mix of fabric styles and price points with outstanding service and quality. Our results for the first quarter also reflect a more stable cost environment in China.

“We are proud of our growing reputation as an innovative and trusted industry leader and our ability to meet the demands of our customers. Looking ahead, we believe our strategies will continue to drive profitable growth in upholstery fabrics for fiscal 2016, especially as the overall economy and the U.S. housing market continue to strengthen,” added Chumbley.

“Maintaining a strong financial position, generating free cash flow and investing in our strategic initiatives will continue to be top priorities for fiscal 2016,” added Ken Bowling, chief financial officer of Culp, Inc. “As of the end of the first quarter, we reported $32.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments compared with $31.0 million a year ago. Consistent with our capital allocation strategy, the company paid a $0.40 per share special dividend during the first quarter, along with the regular quarterly dividend of $0.06 per share, totaling $5.7 million. Total debt was $2.2 million at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2016, which represented the final installment on our term loan. After the end of the quarter, we made this scheduled debt payment on August 11, with no other debt remaining on the company’s balance sheet at this time.”

The company also announced that the Board of Directors approved the payment of the company’s quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per share. This payment will be made on October 15, 2015, to shareholders of record as of October 1, 2015. Future dividend payments are subject to Board approval and may be adjusted at the Board’s discretion as business needs or market conditions change.

Since June 2011, the company has returned approximately $35 million to shareholders in the form of regular quarterly and special dividends and share repurchases.

Commenting on the outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2016, Saxon remarked, “We expect overall sales to be three percent to six percent higher as compared with the second quarter of last year.

“We expect sales in our mattress fabrics segment to be four percent to eight percent higher compared with a strong second quarter in fiscal 2015. Operating income and margin in this segment are expected to be moderately higher than the same period a year ago.

“In our upholstery fabrics segment, we expect sales to be flat to slightly higher than the second quarter of fiscal 2015. We believe the upholstery fabric segment’s operating income and margin will be moderately higher than the same period last year.

“Considering these factors, the company expects to report pre-tax income for the second fiscal quarter of 2016 in the range of $5.5 million to $6.0 million. Pre-tax income for last year’s second quarter was $4.9 million.

“With respect to the full year, capital expenditures for fiscal 2016 are expected to be approximately $8.0 million to $9.0 million, mostly related to expansion and efficiency improvement projects for mattress fabrics. Additionally, the company expects a good year of free cash flow, even with the anticipated high level of capital expenditures and modest growth in working capital. Finally, although there is always uncertainty with longer term forecasts, we currently expect sales and operating performance for the second half of this fiscal year to be comparable or slightly better than the strong results achieved during the second half of last fiscal year.”

In closing, Saxon remarked, “We are pleased with a solid start to fiscal 2016. Going forward, we are well positioned to capitalize on our core strengths – our outstanding design capabilities, innovative product offerings and a scalable and global manufacturing platform that enables us to provide exceptional service to our worldwide customers. At the same time, we have a strong balance sheet and the financial flexibility to continue to drive innovation, enhance our operations and pursue strategic initiatives. We are excited about the opportunities before us as we look ahead to the rest of fiscal 2016 and beyond.”

618,"The 42nd annual Telluride Film Festival promises yet another eclectic mix of fall Oscar hopefuls looking for a leg up on the season and international festival favorites hoping to make waves on these shores.

The four-day event kicks off Friday with a restored version of German filmmaker Fritz Lang’s 275-minute epic “Die Nibelungen” before diving headlong into a program that will feature the world premiere of Danny Boyle’s Michael Fassbender-led “Steve Jobs,” new documentaries from Oscar-winners Charles Ferguson and Davis Guggenheim and the final film from late director Sydney Pollack.

“We always say ‘all glory goes to the filmmakers,’ but we’re really lucky to have a bunch of beautiful, beautiful films,” Telluride executive director Julie Huntsinger said of the lineup, noting that passes sold out “stupefyingly fast” as the fest continues to be a popular mountain retreat for dedicated attendees.

In addition to “Jobs,” there will be a slew of other proper worldwide debuts at the fest, including Lenny Abrahamson’s bestseller adaptation “Room,” Sarah Gavron’s gender equality drama “Suffragette,” Guggenheim’s Malala Yousafzai doc “He Named Me Malala” and Ferguson’s climate change study “Time to Choose.”

A handful of Venice selections will screen in Telluride before heading to the Lido, including Charlie Kaufman and Duke Johnson’s stop-motion “Anomalisa,” performance artist and musician Laurie Anderson’s “Heart of a Dog” (a “dream-like essay poem” narrated by Anderson, according to the program) and Nicolas Saada’s “Taj Mahal,” focused on the November 2008 Islamic terrorist attacks in Mumbai.

In addition, films bowing in Venice set to hustle back across eight time zones for North American bows include Scott Cooper’s Whitey Bulger biopic “Black Mass” with Johnny Depp, Cary Fukunaga’s West African civil war pic “Beasts of No Nation” with Idris Elba and Tom McCarthy’s newsroom drama “Spotlight” with Michael Keaton.

Of particular note is a Sydney Pollack film that was never completed due to sound sync issues…until now. Documenting the 1972 recording session of Aretha Franklin’s biggest-selling album “Amazing Grace,” the film — which takes its title from the album — was “rescued” by former record producer Alan Elliott and will be “one of those movies that people say, ‘I remember where I was when I saw it. I saw it at Telluride and I can’t believe what a cool experience it was,'” Huntsinger said.

There are four Cannes titles on the lineup: Todd Haynes’ 1950s-set lesbian romance “Carol,” Lázló Nemes’ Hungarian Holocaust tale “Son of Saul,” Grímur Hákonarson’s humanist sheep farming drama “Rams” and Kent Jones’ “Hitchcock/Truffaut” documentary.

Meanwhile, Berlin premieres taking a Telluride pit stop on their globe-trotting festival tours include Andrew Haigh’s autumn marriage drama “45 Years,” Guatemala’s first-ever foreign Academy submission “Ixcanul” and Jafar Panahi’s playfully defiant latest “Taxi,” which won Berlin’s highest honor, the Golden Bear, in February.

Tributes have been set for “Jobs” director Danny Boyle, “Carol” star Rooney Mara and documentary filmmaker Adam Curtis (whose “Bitter Lake” will also play the fest). A Special Medallion will be given to Jeff Skoll’s production company Participant Media, with loving words from filmmaker Errol Morris in the program.

“Behind much of Participant’s innovation is the truism that ideas can be sold better in a non-didactic fashion,” the “Fog of War” Oscar winner said. “We are all lucky that Participant exists and remains committed to the public good.”

The company’s roll call of projects has included films such as “An Inconvenient Truth,” “Contagion” and “CitizenFour,” as well as 2015 Telluride selections “Beasts of No Nation” and “Spotlight.”

1576,"Now that the US stock market has gotten in sync with the rest of the world in its ups and downs, it also joins the rest of the world in generally (and loosely; it?s not a minute-by-minute relationship) being inverse to the Gold-Silver ratio (GSR, AKA the ?metallic credit spread? ?Hoye).

Here is the daily view of the GSR, showing a gap up and spike that came with the stock market?s big disturbance and a consolidation down that has come with its relief bounce.  This is a bullish chart and so, it is a short-term bearish chart for US and global stocks.  GSR broke out and is bullish while above the MA 50?s, MACD and RSI are positive and AROON is trend up.

GSR weekly is fully bullish as well.  It adds a long-term up trend to the daily chart?s bull features.  You can see the long and grinding journey upward GSR has taken since it was drubbed in 2010 (into 2011) by full frontal QE, as silver exploded vs. gold and the ?inflation trade? took off in 2010 and eventually blew out (in spring of 2011).

GSR monthly offers a different view however, as it is nearing historical resistance.  Maybe when this resistance is hit it will hold and those who have, shall we say cheered so long and hard for silver can finally deliver the ultimate ?I told you so!? after 4+ years of futility.

The bottom line is that the Gold-Silver ratio indicates more short-term problems in US and global stock markets, commodities and even potentially the precious metals themselves.  But the bigger picture view at least offers a line in the sand (long-term resistance) where an ?inflation trade? may finally get going again.

That scenario could be the product of a saturation of the non-stop inflation that has been promoted in the US and globally by policy makers, with a global deflationary backdrop hiding its effects.  Alternatively, it could be the product of panic by the US Central Bank, should the stock correction get serious enough.  The entire recovery out of 2009 has been, after all, about risk ?on? asset market speculation and wealth effects.

Whatever it is, you can bet that political animals and powerful policy makers alike do not want to see the Gold-Silver ratio break out of its big picture limits."
485,"Last month, the world watched a spectacular crash in the Chinese stock market, in which 30% of the value of shares was wiped out in a matter of weeks.

The government unleashed an astonishing array of measures to try to keep share prices from sliding. Authorities started by allowing huge financial institutions such as insurance companies to increase their exposure to stocks — effectively ordering them to buy shares to support prices.

Then came orders for companies to stop trading, and finally there were threats of arrests for people caught selling stocks. The bleeding stopped, but only after the stock market was practically shut down.

This month, China has stunned the financial world again, by changing a long-standing policy that meant its currency remained relatively stable in its exchange rate against the US dollar.

On Thursday, China weakened the yuan for the third day straight. The bank devalued the yuan by nearly 2%, the largest one-day drop for the currency ever. But it came with an important change in policy that means the currency is likely to be more forcefully determined by the judgment of global financial markets.

So far the moves have been small, but China is such a large part of the global economy that changing how it treats its currency has potentially huge ramifications for businesses and consumers everywhere. This is why people are watching it with such interest.

We have set ourselves the task of explaining what is happening with the currency and why China has taken this step of allowing market forces to play such an important role in setting the value of the yuan so soon after the recent battle over share prices.

There are potential and real consequences for the global economy and markets that result from the new currency regime, and we’ll explore those as well.

We explored this back in 2014 and the best explanation remains the ECRI's 2011 ready reckoner:

Some strategists will just call the currency the renminbi, while others will refer to the CNH and CNY. When you read renminbi, or RMB, just think overall currency level without the nuances of whether it is trading onshore or offshore.

The combination of official interest rates and the traded price of a nation's currency set the monetary conditions within an economy.

All other things equal, when a currency rises against its trading partners or competitors, the sectors of the economy exposed to that rise lose competitiveness, partly as its exports become more expensive. When a currency falls relative to trading partners and competitors, local businesses that export or compete with imports become more competitive.

That's why central banks of small open economies like Australia and New Zealand like to let their currencies float. They believe the currency movements are the other arm to monetary policy and thus help regulate the economic stimulus in the economy. The more open the economy, the greater the impact of currency movements on economic growth.

It's no different for larger economies either. Japan all but debased the yen as Abenomics drove the exchange rate with the US dollar from just under 80 in September 2012 to the recent high around 125 — a move of 56%.

The US dollar weakened materially in the aftermath of the GFC. That helped provide a boost to economic growth in the US by making local producers more competitive to customers, both at home in the US and abroad.

So, with China's economy still dominated by investment in fixed capital along with the export and import of goods and services (which on 2014 estimates equate to roughly 22% and 24% respectively of gross domestic product) the recent strength of the RMB relative to other key currencies has hurt economic growth.

Societe Generale Economist Albert Edwards says this has meant that this has been a dramatic change because over the past 18 months China has had a ""huge swing into a Balance of Payments deficit.""

The balance of payments (BOP) is simply a calculation of all the trade conducted in the economy by the private sector as well as the government sector and associated businesses to determine whether money is flowing into or out of an economy.

Because China has swung into a BOP deficit, Edwards says that means there has been ""chronic downward pressure on the renminbi, forcing the People's Bank of China (PBOC) to start selling its vast foreign exchange reserves to prop up the beleaguered currency (FX reserves have slid $300 billion over the last four quarters).""

This means the PBOC was buying its own currency — not from a position of acute weakness, as we have often seen in Asia, Russia, and at times Australia, but from a position of relative strength.

That is counterproductive for economic growth if it is slowing, as it makes Chinese business and industry less competitive by keeping the RMB higher than it otherwise would be.

Edwards said that left the Chinese currency ""substantially overvalued, especially with the rest of Asia devaluing alongside the Japanese yen. The most shocking illustration of China's loss of competitiveness in recent years is the 50% surge in its Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) against the US.” This basically means the currency has been surging in value against the US dollar, and is illustrated in the chart below.

That set up an untenable situation for Chinese authorities, who were effectively being forced to buying RMB onshore (CNY) to prop up the price when the flow of funds and market forces in offshore trade (CNH), were exerting significant downward force on the level of the currency.

That meant a significant gap opened up between the onshore market, which the PBOC regulates, and the offshore market, where market forces hold a greater sway and the CNH can float more freely.

Christy Tan, the NAB's head of markets strategy and research in Asia, wrote this week that the decision by the PBOC to move on Tuesday and then allow further depreciation over the following two days was because ""China delivered its commitment to close the gap between daily fix and market levels.""

Tan also said the PBOC was running two ""timelines.""

The short term objective is ""one-time correction to close the gap between the central-parity rate and the market rate."" This has been met again today and the PBOC will probably be consistent on this in coming sessions. For the medium term, the PBOC will allow the market to play a bigger role in setting the exchange rate “to facilitate the balancing of international payments.”

The balancing of international payments is what Albert Edwards pointed to as a source of concern.

But the PBOC's commitment to letting market forces set the RMB rate was tested in just the second day of the new regime, with reported intervention on behalf of the PBOC to slow the CNY's weakness in trade.

That drove the exchange rate against the dollar from 6.4486 to close at 6.385. But Thursday morning in letting the currency fix lower again at 6.4010 the PBOC signaled that it was still listening to the signals from the market.

The surprise move by the Chinese to both devalue on Tuesday and the associated regime change that has seen the RMB continue to weaken in onshore and offshore markets created ructions in global stock, bond, commodity, and foreign-exchange markets.

Traders hate uncertainty and in letting the RMB slip anchor, the PBOC has awakened some real fear among global investors, traders and strategists that because the global economy is still fragile this move could be the proverbial straw that breaks the camel’s back.

As case in point is Soc Gen's Edwards, who has dialed up the rhetoric, saying the move by the Chinese this week raises fears of a 2008 style market rout.

China's need to become more competitive can also hurt its neighbors, and Beijing's moves will put pressure on the already fragile emerging Asian economies.

Edwards, and many other commentators, believe that the devaluation — because of the potential for a downward competitive spiral of the region’s currencies — will unleash a new wave of global deflation. They believe that China has joined the currency wars.

Others simply think that the move this week is a reaction to external forces and thus will have less impact. Certainly the move appears to have been catalyzed by the terrible export data for July released on Saturday, and as such could be proof many investors were seeking that the Chinese economy is much weaker than the official figures suggest.

But, while these concerns are valid and the risk of another deflationary pulse is real, this week's market ructions were more likely a result of the very simple fact that markets just hate a shock.

That's because traders get caught on the wrong side of the market. They have to liquidate positions; they need to sell assets in the money to pay for the losses. They hate losing money, and they hate being wrong even more.

And this move by the PBOC was a massive shock because it caught markets on the hop.

Not everyone believes that this move this week is bad news. China has sat by while the countries around them, their competitors and their customers, have seen their currencies slide. That has made China less competitive and more expensive to do business with, while it's made these customers and competitors more attractive for others to do business with and other markets cheaper.

Fears of competitive devaluations as nations race to weaken their currencies are potentially well-founded but unlikely to come to fruition, according to Capital Economics economist David Rees.

Rees said on Thursday that regardless of near-term risks to further weakness:

That, Rees says, means the ""upshot is that once the renminbi sell-off eases, there is room for EM markets to rebound.""

Unlike China's surprise move this week, the Fed has telegraphed well in advance its intention to raise rates sometime this year. Just this week Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart reiterated that September was in play.

But it's the words of Fed vice chair Stanley Fischer that are ringing in the ears of bond and currency traders. Earlier this week, Fischer told Bloomberg, ""Employment has been rising pretty fast relative to previous performance, and yet inflation is very low."" Traders believe that implies the Fed still has enough concern about the low level of inflation in the US to possibly delay the first tightening.

That has seen Fed funds futures probability of a September hike fall to 40% overnight from 70% last week. The US dollar was also sold heavily as a result as traders readjust their bets.

A country's currency is the most important transfer price in the economy. If, as China is, you are an open economy with a large reliance on trade for economic growth, then, as we have highlighted above, the level of your currency is important for accelerating, or slowing, economic growth.

As David Rees highlights, all China is doing is letting its currency catch up to many of the other market-based currency moves. If China weren't running a managed currency regime, then arguably market forces would have driven the RMB substantially lower as soon of the whiff of economic weakness emerged.

It is worth highlighting that China has been a fine global citizen during the acute period of the GFC, where they held their currency stable, and since then when they allowed the RMB to be fairly strong on a global basis.

Equally, for those characterizing this as China joining a global currency war, reference must be made to the price action of the USDCNY rate over the past 12 months against the massive depreciation's of the Aussie dollar, Euro, and Yen. It makes for an interesting graphic.

As David Scutt wrote earlier Thursday, the chart ""suggests the hysterics over the yuan's devaluation may be slightly misplaced.""

Indeed, perhaps more than slightly.

Likewise Allianz’s Mohamed El-Erian told Business Insider that China has made the right move, just perhaps at the wrong time.

El-Erian cuts to the core of the current reaction about China emanating, which is essentially one that says ""what you have done doesn't suit us.""

But, as El-Erian points out, it suits China.

China is the world's second-largest economy. Rather than an open, market-based economy, it is planned economy with market leanings to support the growth aspirations of its people. China has a population of almost 1.4 billion people, almost all of who look to the Chinese Communist Party to put the framework in place for their lives. Beijing understands that in fulfilling this compact with their population for growth, jobs and improved quality of life they will retain their authority within the Chinese political system.

As fanciful as that may sound, the lesson of history is there is nothing like poverty to drive regime change.

So, the core lesson here is suits China. China's neighbors in the South China Sea have been learning that this is how the country is behaving, and it's something international markets will have to get used to as well.

China is emerging, and internationalizing its markets. It has been doing that since 2001 when it joined the World Trade Organisation. In that time its growth has been impressive and it has been a positive force for the global economy.

China's internationalization is continuing, but that for the moment at least, it is taking steps that will bolster its own economic growth profile.

It has been an uncomfortable week. But measures to manage China's economic growth are also good for the health of the global economy.

The big question is whether all this action by Beijing will eventually be enough."

 Nagpur: In another significant move, the sleuths of the Economic Offenses Wing of Nagpur Crime Branch, under the guidance of Deputy Commissioner of Police (EOW & Cyber Crime) Deepali Masirkar, made some very significant progress in the investigation of the ill-reputed Wasankar Case.

While speaking to Nagpur Today, Police Inspector Dane said that they have seized some goods and property belonging to Wasankar and his coterie. The seized goods include the following:

Till date the number of complainants has risen to around 502 and the amount allegedly fleeced by Wasankar and his cohorts is Rs One hundred and thirty six crores.

Wasankar and his cohorts have again applied for bail, but the Special Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors Court (MPID Court) is not inclined to give bail to the accused. However, the MPID Court has directed the Police Officials of Economic Offenses Wing of Nagpur Crime Branch to expedite the investigation into the case and to frame the Charge-sheet at the earliest so that the trials could begin.

A brief about the Wasankar Case

 The ponzi schemes floated by Wasankar Wealth Management being run by Dr. Prashant Wasankar  surfaced in the Second Capital City of Nagpur after a well-planned fraud perpetuated by Shree Surya Group. Wasankar Wealth Management company eroded the hard earn money of over 2000 innocent people by offering them quantum hike in their sum within short span of time. Wasankar charged huge amount membership as much as Rs. 1 lakh per annum and collected over crores of rupees. He assured the depositors by giving them post dated cheques offering around 30% interest on deposit.The sensational Wasankar group fraud case took a new turn after the investigating team dug out hidden property owned by the Wasankar family worth Rs 28 crore. According to sources, a big sum of Wasankar’s black property is being hidden by a builder and a known chef of the city. Wasankar was arrested in connection with the multi-crore scam in duping innocent investors to the tune of crores on July 27, 2014."
2209,"Tiffany & Co. has convinced the United States Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) to review Lazare Kaplan International’s patent for laser-inscribing diamonds, currently the subject of long-running litigation.

The dispute between the two prominent, and often-litigious, industry names was revealed in LKI’s Sept. 1 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

In October 2014, Tiffany first asked the PTAB for inter partes review of LKI’s 2002 patent for laser inscription technology. The lead inventor on the patent is former company vice chairman George R. Kaplan, who died last month.

On April 20, the PTAB granted the request, finding “information presented establishes with a reasonable likelihood that [Tiffany & Co.] would prevail in showing that [two claims in LKI’s patent] are unpatentable.”

The ruling stresses it has not made a final determination of claims in the case. The board also urged the parties to seek alternative dispute resolution.

The review has temporarily halted LKI’s long-running litigation against PhotoScribe, which dates from 2006, for allegedly infringing its inscription patent. (According to an LKI filing, Tiffany is a customer of PhotoScribe.) PhotoScribe says it uses “different technology” and has tried to rule LKI’s patent invalid. The suit has seen many decisions and appeals, with LKI claiming victory in the most recent round.

The Gemological Institute of America was also originally named in LKI’s lawsuit. However, GIA settled with LKI in September 2013, agreeing to make a onetime payment to LKI of $15 million and to pay inscription royalties through July 31, 2016."
322,"Bank of Israel Governor ranks as one of best in the world Karnit Flug ranked by Global Finance magazine as one of nine best central bank governors in the world for second year in a row. Bank of Israel Governor Karnit Flug has made the Global Finance's list of best central bank governers for the second year in a row. The magazine Global Finance published Thursday its annual ranking of the world's central bank governors. Flug received an A ranking, along with another eight central bankers. It ranks them from A to F, the measures affecting the score are coping with and gaining control of inflationary pressures, meeting objectives of economic growth, domestic currency stability and interest rate management. A marks a perfect job whereas F complete failure. Other central bankers who received an A grade for a second year in a row were India's Raghuram Rajan, Malaysia's Zeti Akhtar Aziz, the Phillipines' Amando Tetangco Jr., and Taiwan's Fai-Nan Peng. Global Finance publisher and editorial director Joseph Giarraputo notes, “Global economies are starting to recover. This comes despite a number of challenges, including a strengthening US dollar and the end of the Federal Reserve’s easy money policy. Central bankers remain crucial in overcoming these hurdles. Sound monetary policies can dampen the effects of currency swings and rising interest rates—and thus spur economic growth. ""As our scores show, some central banks have fared better than others in devising such policies. Our grades also reflect the willingness of central bankers to stand up to political interference as well as their ability to influence government policies on spending and foreign investment.”

2315,"In response to an unsparing audit by its watchdog, the Department of Housing and Urban Development has flipped its stance and now says it is urging housing authorities nationwide to evict tenants who earn too much to qualify for government subsidies.

The initiative represents an about-face from the agency’s earlier response to the audit by HUD’s inspector general. That review found that more than 25,000 tenants make more than the maximum income allowed to qualify for public housing. The threshold varies depending on local economic circumstances, ranging, for example, from an income limit of $32,750 for a family of four in the District to $14,500 in Mississippi.

Although many of the “over income” tenants exceeded the limit by a small amount, the audit revealed that nearly half were over the threshold by $10,000 to $70,000. And some of the cases were eye-popping, such as a family of four in New York City with a $497,911 salary that is paying $1,574 in rent for a three-bedroom apartment in public housing.

[A family in public housing makes $498,000 a year. And HUD wants tenants like this to stay]

The review, released late last month, said that some public housing tenants who exceed HUD’s low-income threshold are committing “egregious” abuses and are squeezing out truly needy families.

“This audit, like others, provides HUD an opportunity to re-evaluate policies and initiatives and make improvements where necessary,” agency spokesman Jereon M. Brown said Wednesday in a statement. “As a result, HUD is taking additional steps to encourage housing authorities to establish policies that will reduce the number of over income families in public housing.”

Housing authorities must grapple with competing priorities when setting policy. Officials say they do not want to discourage tenants from trying to improve their economic circumstances by threatening to evict them if they find better paying jobs, and housing experts have recognized that it is healthier to have people of various incomes living together instead of perpetuating isolated pockets of poverty.

[Why it actually won’t be easy to kick out public housing tenants who earn too much ]

But waiting lists of people who truly need affordable housing are long, and taxpayers oppose subsidizing tenants who can pay market rents.

When HUD was first presented with the conclusions of the draft audit by Inspector General David Montoya’s office, the agency strongly objected to all of them.

Milan Ozdinec, HUD’s deputy assistant secretary for public housing and voucher programs, wrote that “there are positive social benefits from having families with varying income levels residing in the same property” and warned that “amending policies to force over-income families to leave could negatively affect their interest and full participation in achieving self-sufficiency.” He accused the inspector general of “over-emphasizing” a problem when higher-earning tenants represent just 2.6 percent of the 1.1 million families in public housing.

With the audit’s findings gaining public attention in recent days, however, the agency has shifted its emphasis, seeking to underline that the primary goal of public housing is to help those with few other options.

HUD spokesman Cameron French described the agency’s first response to the audit as “merely an initial explanation of facts, not a policy recommendation.” He said, “HUD senior management is now actively pursuing policy changes in response to the findings,” and added that the agency “does not condone any of the egregious examples of over income cited in the audit.”

Agency officials have begun calling and e-mailing housing authorities that the audit found to have higher numbers of over-income tenants. Federal officials say they are telling their local counterparts that these tenants must leave to make room for the needy.

“We are directly engaged in conversations with the housing authorities identified within the audit as having residents who were over the income limit,” Brown said. “We anticipate issuing additional guidance on the topic this fall and working with local housing authorities to provide greater opportunity for more families.”

In New York City, which has the country’s largest concentration of public housing, auditors found almost 11,000 over-income tenants, with 302,000 families waiting to get into subsidized apartments.

A spokeswoman said the housing authority “supports income diversity and is, overall, invested in the goal of attacking concentrations of poverty throughout this city.” The authority did not seem inclined to urge its high-earning tenants to leave the system.

“Removing the relatively small number of higher-income residents from public housing would remove more than $90 million in revenue” from higher rents those tenants pay, the spokeswoman said.

HUD has limited ability to evict higher-earning tenants. Although the federal government provides the subsidies, more than 3,000 state and local housing authorities run the programs. And HUD’s leverage also is constrained because, under the law, families can stay in subsidized homes as long as they want, no matter how much money they make, as long as they are good tenants.

Agency officials have added language to a pending regulation that would make explicit the goal of encouraging tenants to surrender their subsidized housing if their income rises above the maximum allowed. On Wednesday, HUD officials said they plan to hold discussions with members of Congress about the possibility of introducing legislation that would give authorities the power to force high-earning tenants out of public housing.

In Newark, auditors identified 134 over-income tenants in public housing, while 15,470 people were on the waiting list for subsidized apartments.

Spokeswoman Gloria Wright said the Newark Housing Authority has long worried that evicting these tenants, when the law allows them to stay, would put local officials at risk of violating fair-housing laws by treating some tenants differently from others. That would jeopardize the agency’s federal funding.

“It puts us in a pickle,” she said. “So we have to work with them, to encourage them to buy a house, or move out to a market-rate apartment.”

In the farm belt town of Oxford, Neb., which has 20 tiny one-bedroom subsidized apartments, Cindy Haussler, director of the local housing authority, said the board of directors will review HUD’s new policy.

She said that current federal funding is not enough to cover costs, so the housing authority depends on allowing over-income tenants to stay and charging them higher rents. That includes someone who earned $65,007 last year — double the income limit — and has assets valued at nearly $1.6 million. As of April, this tenant was paying $300 a month, auditors found, more than other tenants, but still not market rate.

“You don’t want to bite the hand that feeds you,” Haussler said of HUD. “But I have to pay our bills. We’re running a business.”

Even before the inspector general’s review, HUD officials said they were pushing for legislation in Congress that would prod higher-earning tenants to leave public housing on their own. Starting this year, whenever a tenant’s income exceeds the maximum for qualifying for a subsidized home, housing authorities are required to set the rent at 80 percent of the fair market rent for the apartment. The new rules are being phased in over three years.

The HUD inspector general concluded that these rules have only “marginal” potential to coax tenants from public housing, because rent increases are limited to no more than 35 percent a year, “and [this] may not prevent the egregious cases illustrated” in the audit.

2282,"A judge threw out a lawsuit against two Whidbey real-estate companies over noise disclosures related to aircraft noise Friday afternoon.

“We were victorious,” said Eric Mitten, broker and owner with Windermere Real Estate. “The judge ruled that the disclosure was adequate to put buyers on notice that there was aircraft noise.”

Attorneys representing two Coupeville residents, Jonathan Deegan and Alice O’Grady, filed the class action complaint for damages and injunctive relief against Windermere Real Estate and Acorn Properties on Nov. 18, 2014.

The lawsuit argued that the residents were given only one of two noise disclosure related to Navy aircraft noise that are required under Island County code.

Attorneys representing the real estate company filed a motion to dismiss in May. The motion argues, in part, that the defendants committed no unfair or deceptive acts under the state Consumer Protection Act because the disclosure that was provided was enough to alert the homeowners to the noise impacts and that reasonable inspection would have revealed the facts available in the other disclosure statement.

In the end, the judge agreed with the real-estate companies and dismissed the lawsuit. The hearing was heard in Skagit County Superior Court after Island County judges recused themselves.

Under Island County code, the commissioners require real estate agents to present two different disclosure to prospective buyers of homes within the “impacted areas” in the vicinity of Whidbey Island Naval Air Station’s Ault Field in Oak Harbor and the Outlying Field near Coupeville.

The lawsuit claims violation of the state Consumer Protection Act. It asks for class-action status, as well as damages and a requirement that the real estate company provide the correct disclosure.

Real estate companies had been providing buyers with a one-paragraph disclosure, which comes from a 1993 ordinance regarding the sound-proofing of building in noise zones. But a different ordinance, adopted in 1992, includes much more details for a separate disclosure, including a pronouncement that “noise generated by a single flyover of a military jet may exceed 100 DBA,” the lawsuit states.

The plaintiffs claim that in recent years that aircraft noise has increased with the introduction of the EA-18G Growler and additional practice flights at OLF Coupeville. The lawsuit states that community members complained to the county commissioners that they were never told about the “extremely loud noise and vibrations.”

“After investigation, Island County’s government discovered that the complaints had merit — real estate sellers and brokers were not giving ICC 9.44.050’s mandatory disclosure,” the lawsuit states.

In December of 2013, the Island County planning director wrote a memorandum to the board of commissioners noting that sellers were not providing buyers with both disclosure statements. In response, the Whidbey Island Association of Realtors took “prompt action to correct its standard disclosure,” according to the motion to dismiss.

By the end of January of 2014, real estate agents started using an updated disclosure form that included language from both ordinances, the defendants’ motion states."
509,"AFTER sweating through a day’s work under the hot Dubai sun, the last thing an Indian construction worker wants is to donate a slug of his earnings to a bank or money-transfer outfit. Yet that is what he must do. On average, 6.9 cents of every dollar remitted to India from another country is eaten up by fees and foreign-exchange margins, according to the World Bank. Indians get off relatively lightly. A sub-Saharan African migrant loses an average of 9.7 cents.

In 2009 the G8 pledged to cut the average cost of international remittances to 5% of the sum sent within five years. Rates have since come down, but not by much: the average is now 7.7%. And the implicit tax on remittances is even higher than these figures suggest, since they are based on transfers of $200, but many payments are smaller.

In part, Dilip Ratha of the World Bank blames the exclusive agreements signed by banks and other companies involved in handling remittances. By reducing competition, these keep prices high. Some countries, including India, have banned such tie-ups, but they remain common in Africa. In 2014 the Overseas Development Institute, a think-tank, estimated that if the average cost of sending money to Africa could be cut to 5%, it would mean $1.8 billion more for the continent every year.

Still, Mr Ratha is optimistic. Challengers to the banks and big money-transfer firms are popping up, particularly in London. Flush with venture capital, they claim they can use technology to cut costs. TransferWise began as a peer-to-peer foreign-exchange service for the rich world; Taavet Hinrikus, one of its founders, says India is now the firm’s fastest-growing destination. It plans to offer transfers to Mexico soon.

Sending money abroad is comparatively simple. The difficulty lies in getting the cash to spouses and parents in poor countries, who probably do not have bank accounts and may live a long way from a bank branch. Big money-transfer outfits like MoneyGram and Western Union have hundreds of thousands of agents and thus a colossal advantage in the cash market. But Ismail Ahmed, of WorldRemit, an online transfer service, reckons the rapid growth of mobile money in places like Kenya, Somaliland and Zimbabwe is eroding this advantage. Most of the money sent to Africa through WorldRemit goes to mobile accounts.

Technology can do less to tackle another problem. Anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorism regulations are making banks reluctant to clear transfers to conflict- or crime-racked spots such as Somalia, which depends on remittances. “Derisking”, as this trend is known, is spreading to bigger countries. Odilon Almeida of Western Union says this is bound to reduce competition and thus drive up prices. It is also, probably, pushing remittances into obscure and illegal channels, which is no good for anybody."

1027,"The print edition of the Hollywood Reporter goes deep on the story of a coveted parcel of land on the ridge line above Beverly Hills that it calls ""the last Los Angeles real estate trophy."" At 157 acres, it has room to build several estates, and already has some streets. The property has beguiled celebrity real estate investors for years, including some big Hollywood names.



 The saga behind one of the most pedigreed and controversial pieces of property in L.A. could be torn from the pages of a Coen brothers script. After 15 years of intense legal drama over ownership, family squabbling and an inheritance, The Vineyard might be changing hands again. And what once was no more than a dusty mountaintop has been transformed into an exquisite plateau with a helicopter pad and ample room for any architect's wildest fantasies. ""It's the most spectacular property anywhere in Los Angeles,"" says Robert Mann, an attorney who is familiar with The Vineyard. Now, with real estate prices soaring in Los Angeles and foreign buyers pouring in, The Vineyard is poised to be the most talked-about trophy property in years.

257,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Republican front-runner Donald Trump on Thursday bowed to pressure from the party establishment and signed a pledge not to run as an independent candidate in the November 2016 presidential election.

His vow of loyalty was something of a victory for the Republican National Committee in its efforts to rein in the billionaire, who leads opinion polls while at the same time upsetting mainstream Republicans with his brash style.

But the pledge does not appear to be legally binding and does nothing to halt Trump's personal attacks against Republican rivals and stinging rhetoric on issues like immigration that have shaken up the race for the nomination.

At a news conference in his own Trump Tower in Manhattan,

the property magnate waved the loyalty pledge, signed in a thick black marker, in the air for TV cameras.

""I see no circumstances under which I would tear up that pledge,"" he said.

Trump had previously refused to rule out a third-party bid, drawing boos from the crowd in Ohio last month at the first full Republican debate.

An independent Trump candidacy could split support for the Republican Party and give the Democrats a huge boost by taking

many blue-collar male Republican voters with him.

He said on Thursday he received ""absolutely nothing other than the assurance that I would be treated fairly"" in return for signing the pledge.

The reality TV star had come under intense pressure in recent weeks from the RNC and its chairman, Reince Priebus, who met with him on Thursday.

""It reflects a lot of behind the scenes work,"" an RNC official said.

Priebus announced in a statement later on Thursday that all 17 Republican candidates had agreed to the pledge.

Trump may also have been reacting to goading from rival Jeb Bush, who this week released a video accusing him of being a Democrat in disguise and holding liberal positions on abortion rights, taxes and healthcare.

""I don’t know what motivated (Trump) specifically, but the problem is that it’s a non-binding deal,"" said Dave Carney, an unaligned Republican strategist in New Hampshire. He said the pledge had some meaning during the primary process, which is run by state parties, but not during the general election, which is organized by state governments.

Almost two months after reaching the top of opinion polls among Republicans, Trump has come under sustained fire for the first time from Bush, the former governor of Florida.

Reuters/Ipsos polling showed Trump with support among nearly 31 percent of self-identified Republicans as of Tuesday, with Bush at nearly 12 percent, behind former neurosurgeon Ben Carson. http://bit.ly/1hWTSGh

Trump fired a salvo back on Thursday in a fight with Bush over immigrants and the role of English.

""I think that when you get right down to it, we're a nation that speaks English and I think while we are in this nation we should be speaking English,"" he said. ""Whether people like it or not, that's how we assimilate.""

In turn, Bush made fun of Trump's pledge by tweeting a photograph of a piece of paper with the words ""Voted Republican since 1972,"" on it and signed by Bush.

Political parties at the state level often ask candidates to sign loyalty pledges, but it is unprecedented for Republicans in a presidential election.

Another of the Republican candidates, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, said the Trump pledge was ""just a little too much drama."""
408,"- European Central Bank (ECB) to Keep Rates on Hold, Retain EUR 60B QE Program.

For more updates, sign up for David's e-mail distribution list.

Even though the European Central Bank (ECB) is widely expected to retain its current policy in September, the fresh updates coming out of the Governing Council may trigger a selloff in EUR/USD should the committee show a greater willingness to expand/extend its quantitative easing (QE) program.

Click Here for the DailyFX Calendar

Why Is This Event Important:Dovish rhetoric accompanied by a downward revision in the ECB’s growth & inflation forecast is likely to dampen the appeal of the Euro, and central bank President Mario Draghi may talk up bets for additional monetary support in an effort to further insulate the fragile recovery in Europe.

The ECB may take additional steps to shore up the ailing economy as it struggles to achieve its one and only mandate for price stability, and bets for more easing may lead EUR/USD to give back the rebound from the previous month amid the growing deviation in the policy outlook.

Nevertheless, we may get more of the same from the ECB as the non-standard measures work through the real economy, and the near-term bound in EUR/USD may gather pace in September should the central bank endorse a wait-and-see approach.

How To Trade This Event Risk(Video)

Impact that the ECB rate decision has had on EUR/USD during the last meeting

The European Central Bank (ECB) stuck to its current policy in July, with the Governing Council keeping the benchmark interest rate at the record-low of 0.05%, while preserving its pledge to ‘fully implement’ the quantitative easing program. Despite the ongoing concerns surrounding the Greek crisis, the ECB may keep its asset-purchase program capped at EUR 60B/month as the central bank sees a ‘moderate’ recovery in Europe. The bullish market reaction to the ECB rate decision was short-lived, with EUR/USD falling back from a session high of 1.0925 and closing the day at 1.0869.

2311,"Alibaba will report first-quarter earnings before the markets open Wednesday, in a potential test of whether the e-commerce giant can weather sluggish growth in the Chinese economy.

Analysts estimate Alibaba will report earnings of 58 cents a share off $3.4 billion in revenue for the quarter. Concerns over economic turmoil in China continue to linger. On Tuesday, China’s yuan slid nearly 2% following data that shows trade was growing weaker.

""People are really wondering about the potential and actual impact on Alibaba’s financial results,"" says S&P Capital IQ analyst Scott Kessler.

As Alibaba approaches a full year since the launch of its initial public offering last September, the stock has tumbled. After reaching a high of $119.15 in November, Alibaba shares plunged below $80.

However, Alibaba’s business is still “very healthy,” says Kessler. “They’ll continue to make substantial investments.”

Recent moves by Alibaba suggest the company is making a big push toward international expansion. They hired Goldman Sachs executive Michael Evans as president, where he will help develop Alibaba’s international plans.

Last month, the company announced it will invest $1 billion into its cloud computing business, citing the growth of fellow tech giant Amazon. Earlier this year, Alibaba's cloud-computing service Aliyun opened a data center in the U.S., and more are planned for the Middle East, Singapore, Japan and Europe.

“Amazon has been able to grow a tremendously successful cloud business by realizing they have so much capacity in their own data centers, that they could lease some of that capacity out and do so at a very high margin,"" says Wedbush Securities analyst Gil Luria. ""Alibaba saw how successful Amazon was and decided to jump into the fray.”

Luria says Alibaba will likely report another strong quarter, and does not expect the e-commerce giant to note struggles in the Chinese economy.

“They’ve reported two very strong quarters as a public company,” he says."

2060,"Remember when you used to think learning how to spell was a useless waste of time and cursed your teachers for making you do something that would never have any real-world benefit? Turns out you were wrong.

Missing just a few letters in a web address can cost you the money in your bank account, or start an all-out identity theft attack, because of a type of fraud called ""typosquatting.""

Typosquatting is a type of online fraud based on the assumption that people are predictably bad at spelling.

""When you look at people who are typing in domain names, when they type them into web browsers at home, we find that with a certain regularity, people make the same typos over and over again,"" says Matthew Green, an assistant research professor at the Johns Hopkins Information Security Institute in Baltimore.

That creates an opportunity for hackers.

""People anticipate that, and they try to go out and find those common misspellings, and they register them and put up copies of a bank's website that look identical, and then they use them to get people's credentials,"" Green says. ""The idea is to put out a net. You hope that some people will make some mistakes.""

Rajiv Motwani, director of security research at Websense Security Labs, gives an example of what a typical typosquatting attack might look like.

Say criminals wanted to target Bank of America customers. They might register ""BankofAmerlca.com,"" one letter off from the bank's actual domain, and set up a fake site. (This is also known as ""spoofing."")

""The attacker puts up a page that looks very much like Bank of America's website, so you will go ahead and enter your credentials there, thinking you are logging into the bank,"" Motwani says.

From there, it's off to the races, Green says.

""They can then log on to your banking website and transfer money and do all kinds of things,"" Green says.

Typosquatting has been around for a while, so many financial institutions have taken steps to protect customers, Green says.

""Some sites now go out of their way to go lock up and register all the common, closely related domain names, and they also will monitor to see if you're registering another one that's too close, but not everyone does that, unfortunately,"" he says.

Why not? It mostly comes down to cost.

""(Registering a web domain) only costs maybe $10 a year, but if you're trying to lock up 50 of them, most small websites don't have the resources to do that,"" Green says.

There are some actions consumers can take to protect their accounts, he says. An obvious one is, when visiting financial sites, double-check the URL before logging in.

""Be very careful entering things,"" Green says. ""If you're going to PayPal or you're going to your bank, just be very careful and pay attention to what you type.""

Another way is to make sure you're on your bank's real website by looking at the address bar on your browser. Next to the lock icon that should appear on any site where you're logging in to a financial account, up-to-date versions of Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome will have the name of the company that has registered the site, Green says.

And because customers rarely know they've fallen victim, it's always a good idea to keep a close eye on your account statements so you can clue in quickly to fraudulent activity.

""They're not going to know there's a mistake,"" Green says. ""They think they went to their own bank website.""

If you think you've been a victim of fraud, it's also a good idea to check your credit report for unusual activity. Get your report for free at myBankrate."

1675,"In 2008, probably like everybody in the civilized world, I was reading reports in newspapers of a mini-gold rush when the price of gold went above $1,000 an ounce for the first time. The psychological impact of gold going through that barrier, coupled with the recession, encouraged people to go and do things they wouldn’t normally have done, such as pick up a shovel, pick, and pan and head off into the mountains.

Even by Californian standards it’s jaw-dropping beautiful. But it doesn’t seem like a place you’d find gold because it’s populated. The gold is there though. Every year, it is washed down from higher up in the mountains and finds its way to bedrock, which, in the case of the Bear River, is a very shingly riverbed. All you have to do is dig down to bedrock. Unfortunately, you’ve also got to make your way through several feet of water to get to it.

I was directed to the Bear River by a prospector who took pity on me because I wasn’t finding anything. She sent me to meet a guy called “Bear River Gary.” Like a lot of people I met, he was incredibly generous with his time. That surprised me. I thought looking for gold would be a very solitary enterprise. But everybody I met found the time to put down their tools and give me advice. So I found myself up to my chest in mud with Bear River Gary, trying to dig down to bedrock, and actually finding gold.

No, it’s terribly civilized these days! For the most part, it’s people who do it as a hobby, from Friday to Sunday afternoon, on rivers close to campgrounds. There are some who do it very seriously and try to make a living out of it. You’ll find them in far more isolated places, in the far north of California, near the border with Oregon, in a place called the Siskiyou Wilderness.

I got in touch with the U.S. Geological Survey, and they said, ‘Yes, we’re aware of that figure; we can’t argue with it; we also don’t know where it came from.’ [Laughs] However, when you consider that there’s a 120-mile long, intermittent vein of gold running through the foothills of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, every year some of it is bound to get washed down from higher up. Last year, a guy found a five-pound nugget in Butte County, California. He won’t say where. But it fetched $400,000 at auction.

It depends on the person. The weekenders do it for fun. They’re mostly not desperate, though I did meet some people for whom this was possibly a last option. You shouldn’t feel sorry for them, because it doesn’t mean they’re not enjoying what they do. I met one guy who was a former marine. He had had a carpentry business, which he’d lost when he developed stomach cancer.

He survived, but he was completely penniless and, like some other Vietnam vets, went off the grid and lived in the woods, bowhunting and surviving on his wits. Then he discovered gold prospecting. He had two inner tubes. He would put his rucksack and equipment in one, then sit in the other with a bottle of vodka and a cocktail shaker and sail down the river until he ran aground. He would then prospect where he landed. He reckons he earns between $300 and $500 dollars a week. For his lifestyle, that’s plenty. And I’ve rarely met a more contented or happier person

Once people arrived in California, they realized all of the old rules had been torn up. The East was still quite a formal society. But in California, anything went. People were making deals on the hoof; towns would rise up within weeks. It was quite brutal. But as things developed, people realized the way they were living was more vibrant and vital than back East.

It was an exciting opportunity to build a new country within a new country. More than anything, it was the belief that anything is possible. The vision of what you could do in California started to filter back to the rest of the country. There was a sense of admiration for what the Californians had achieved so quickly with so little except human resourcefulness. That rippled across the states and made the rest of America realize what it was capable of.

When I met him, he had just carried his pick, pan, shovel, and a sluice box—a machine for filtering dirt on his back about a half a mile, over boulders and rocks, with one leg that hardly worked and two crutches. He did that three times a week and said it had saved his life because he now had a purpose. When you see gold in the pan, there’s nothing quite like it. It lifts your spirits."

1010,"(Credit: MoneyTimes) The dwindling revenues in debt and fixed income markets are propelling major banks towards equity trading. The adverse conditions in Chinese market and Greek economy are also forcing the US banks to trade in equities to minimise the risk

Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs were the top-three beneficiaries in equity trading revenues during the second quarter of 2015.



However, the adverse conditions in China and Greece are likely to impact on revenues in the third quarter. The top three banks put together account for over 40% market share in equities trading.



The turbulent market conditions in the world's second-largest economy and uncertainty in Greek economy will reduce the equity trading revenues, according to a report by Keefe, Bruyette & Woods (KBW).



Morgan Stanley topped the list of 13 banks engaged in trading revenues during the quarter. Morgan Stanley's trading revenues during the quarter grew 26.9% to $2.27 billion. Goldman Sachs registered trading revenues of $1.97bn.



JPMorgan stood at third slot with trading revenues of $1.58bn with a growth rate of 26.8%. In terms of market share in trading, Morgan Stanley has 15.8% followed by Goldman Sachs with 13.7% and JPMorgan with 11% market share.



In 2014, Goldman Sachs topped the list of major banks in equity trading with total equity revenues of $1.9bn followed by Morgan Stanley with $1.57 billion, JPMorgan with $1.15 billion, Bank of America with $960mn and Citigroup with $666 million.



As part of crisis management, the Chinese government has been taking several measures to bring back normalcy into the market. Towards this, the dragon country relaxed norms to keep tabs on trading in Chinese stocks. This has helped many banks in equities trading during the second quarter, opines KBW.



The stock markets in the US and the European Union (EU) are witnessing encouraging growth so far during the third quarter as well. The major reason for this equity volume growth is soaring transactions in derivatives as banks and financial institutions prefer to offset the risk in spot trading. Derivatives offer different products in futures and options (F&O) to offset the risk in equity trading. 



Bank of America's (BoA) equity revenues grew 13.1% to $1.18 billion while Citigroup's trading revenues eased by one percent to $653 million. Equities outperformed fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC) in trading revenues. FICC trading revenues fell by 12.1% on year-on-year (YoY). 



Last year, the high volatility in the debt market forced the banks to do more trading in equities to minimize the risk. Generally, the fourth quarter of any year would be slack. During the fourth quarter of 2014, debt trading revenues of major banks fell steeply following the adverse conditions in the debt market triggered by unforeseen volatility. 



Many US banks have revised their business strategies after the negative impact caused by the debt market. Banks such as Morgan Stanley have adopted new trading strategies on equity trading as trading in fixed income dwindled down steeply.

2096,"Report after report finds that payday lenders, auto title loan firms and pension advance operations unfairly target vulnerable consumers with high fees and questionable terms, but a new investigative piece from The Washington Post shows that are some lesser-known, but very lucrative players offering quick cash to vulnerable consumers: structured settlement purchasing companies.

The Washington Post details how this industry has settled into impoverished areas of Maryland, buying hundreds of thousands of dollars in structured settlement payments for pennies on the dollar, sometimes with very negative financial outcomes for struggling, disabled consumers.

Here’s how it works: when a consumer sues a company or an individual and wins their case, they are often provided some kind of settlement.

Traditionally, these settlements are paid in an immediate lump sum. But in some cases, a structured settlement may be agreed upon. The consumer then receives regular payments for a set time period. Such settlements can be structured to last decades, and for the victims of childhood lead poisoning, an injury that can cause life-long mental impairment, a structured settlement can provide long-term stability.

They may sound uncommon, but these structured settlements are big business. Insurance companies have committed an estimated $350 billion to the settlements since 1975.

As a result, a secondary market has sprung up in which firms compete to purchase the rights to those payments in exchange for providing a cash lump sum that is less than the total value the consumer would be entitled to for the life of the settlement.

Those who support this market contend the companies provide needed funds to help cash-strapped people buy homes, go to schools and pay medical bills. But consumer advocates argue the companies are turning a profit at the expensive of very vulnerable populations.

We really recommend that you head over and read the entire report from the Post, but here are the 10 things we learned from the exposé:

1. Though the cause of the phenomenon is in dispute, Baltimore seems to have become a something of a hotbed for companies seeking to buy structured settlements from disabled persons – especially those affected by childhood lead poisoning. Such injuries can lead to life-long mental impairment, which may affect the consumers’ ability to understand the deals they are making with structured settlement buyers.

2. While Maryland signed the Structured Settlement Protection Act into effect in 2000 to better protect consumers, critics say the measure is failing, with companies finding loopholes that put consumers at risk. The bill outlines several requirements that must be met before payments can be signed away, including a stipulation that sellers speak to an independent advisor before selling their payments. But, as the Post shows, these meetings sometimes provide little help to the seller.

3. One such independent advisor tells the Post that he generally doesn’t go “over the terms of the contract. That wasn’t my function. I don’t think any of the other lawyers do that, or else they would never get any repeat business.” His advising was mostly done over the phone and took less than a minute.

The Post reports that some independent advisors, while they don’t work for a purchasing company, often deal with the same businesses over and over, cultivating close relationships. Critics say this presents a conflict of interest that puts consumers at risk.

4. While there are several settlement purchasing companies in the state and across the U.S., the Post focuses on one that appears to operating heavily in Baltimore: Access Funding.

A review of court records, interviews with industry insiders and victims, found that since 2013 Access Funding has filed nearly 200 structured settlement purchases in Maryland. A majority of those cases involved victims of lead poisoning. In all, the sample of cases reviewed by the Post found Access Funding petitioned to purchase $6.9 million worth of future payments for just $1.7 million.

5. In 52 of those deals, the Post found that on average Access Funding paid just 33-cents on the present value of a dollar, or sometimes less. In one case a 24-year-old lead victim sold nearly $327,000 worth of payments for less than $16,200 — or about 9-cents on the dollar.

6. Another example includes an entire family that had been awarded settlements related to lead paint poisoning. In all, the family relinquished $435,000 of their settlement for about $54,000 – or less than 20-cents on the dollar – to Access Funding.

7. Perhaps the most heartbreaking case reported by the Post is that of Vincent, a 25-year-old who grew up in a house that doctors called a “lead pit,” with the level of lead in his blood stream often being three times that of what is considered “elevated.” One medical professional couldn’t determine whether the man was “severely disabled” or just “generally disabled” as a result.

As with other examples cited by the Post, the man sold some of his payments to Access Funding. According to the Post, in an affidavit written by the company and signed by the man in 2013, he sold $90,000 of his settlement for $26,000 to “purchase a vehicle.” The money, the affidavit said, would also be used to “look for work and also need furniture, clothes, school supplies for my young daughter.” But the man doesn’t have a daughter, he has a son. And he doesn’t have a driver’s license.

After that settlement, the man attempted to complete two other sales, one that was eventually dismissed. As with the previous deals, the affidavits included perplexing statements, such as the man didn’t want to incur costs of renting any longer, or that he wanted to make a purchase of a home. However, he had just purchased a home and hadn’t needed to pay rent for months.

In all, he was willing to let go $663,000 of his lead paint settlement for just $50,000. When asked about the settlements by a Post reporter, the man asked “what settlement.”

8. While all of these deals must receive the approval of a court, the Post points out that Maryland law doesn’t require the settlement recipient to show up in court. As a result, many cases take just minutes to become finalized. In fact, one judge has overseen 160 petitions from Access Funding, approving the requests almost 90% of the time.

9. An executive for Access Funding defended the company’s affidavits and petitions.

“What we do is provide equity for those people to buy homes,” he said, noting that the company had no reason to think those who had signed onto deals were impaired or unable to understand what they were doing.

The man says the company doesn’t target lead victims and that Baltimore’s glut of lead-paint lawsuits has artificially inflated the company’s business in the city. Still, he tells the Post that he would welcome stricter legislation and oversight, simply so the company can secure themselves “in the future from any potential questions like this again, so we can say, ‘No, that’s not us.’”

10. Lawmakers are attempting to put an end to these situations by calling for tighter restrictions on the structured settlement purchasing industry. The Post reports that following its exposé on the industry, Members of the House of Delegates and Attorney General ­Brian E. Frosh pressed for increased scrutiny of these transactions.

881,"One of the manifestations of panic in the financial markets is indiscriminate selling.

This is measured by the asset correlations, or the degree to which the prices of two assets move in the same direction. When correlations go up as prices are tanking, it means people are just dumping everything with little regard to the asset-specific fundamentals. It's something that's been observed repeatedly during past financial crises.

""High volatility goes hand in hand with higher correlation — stocks move together,"" UBS' Julian Emanuel wrote on Tuesday. ""China and the Fed have once again changed the emphasis from Alpha to Beta."" (Alpha measures the degree to which you can generate an excess return. Beta is the degree to which a stock moves with the market as a whole.)

According to Morgan Stanley's Andrew Sheets, the correlation between stock prices hit a 15-year high on the day we saw the Dow crash 1,089 points and the S&P 500 closed down 3.9%. People were dumping everything.

""Realized correlations rose significantly in August, particularly for mid and large caps,"" Credit Suisse's Lori Calvasina wrote. ""Relative to other industry groups, realized correlations are high in Banks, Real Estate, Autos, small cap Energy and small cap Utilities and low in Food Beverage & Tobacco.""

But as they say, out of crisis comes opportunity.

""In the short run, high correlations indicate that global equities are due a bounce,"" Citi's Robert Buckland said in an August 27 note to clients. ""Citi strategists think that it is too early to call the end of this 6 year bull market ... As a team we would recommend that investors buy into this dip, but don't chase any subsequent rally too far."""
480,"HONG KONG -- Luxury apartment blocks in London, penthouses in New York, condominiums with Sydney harbor views -- China's slowing economy, market turmoil and devalued currency are leading Chinese investors to convert their yuan into bricks and mortar.

""Australians might think they've seen a lot of Chinese investment in the Sydney and Melbourne property market, but we ain't seen nothing yet,"" Colonial First State Global Asset Management chief economist Stephen Halmarick told the Sydney Morning Herald last month.

A “knee-jerk” reaction from investors could actually boost Chinese investment in overseas real estate, as investors seek security in more stable markets, and aim to convert their yuan into other currencies, ahead of further possible devaluation.

Reforms in China earlier this year, aimed at liberalization of China's equity, bond and currency markets, have inflated asset prices across the world, especially property.

During the first half of 2015, Chinese investment in overseas commercial properties, which is a proxy for outbound residential investment, according to the Wall Street Journal, totaled $6.5 billion, well on track to surpass 2014’s total of $10.5 billion, according to CBRE, a U.S.-based property services firm.

Despite the slowing Chinese economy this year, investors in that country have been doubling down on overseas real estate in the first half of 2015. Spending by Chinese investors -- already the largest group of foreign real estate buyers in the U.S., with 16 percent of the single homes and condominiums purchased by foreign buyers, according to the National Home Buyer's Alliance -- eclipsed its 2014 levels by 68 percent in the first half of this year.

The trend, at least in the short term, is likely to continue.

“The slowdown in the [Chinese] economy is actually pushing people out to invest, because the returns from outside China are a lot better than those you can get at home,” Terrance Tang, managing director of capital markets and investment services, Asia, at international real estate services firm Colliers International, told International Business Times.

“[Investors] will have to evaluate whether, after the devaluation, the returns are still justifiable, particularly given the fact that there may be more devaluation,” he added.

Among real estate brokers, on the front lines of the market, confidence in continuing flows of Chinese capital, for now, remains high.

Li Keqiang, premier of the People's Republic of China and party secretary of the State Council, speaks at a news conference in October 2014. In remarks published Saturday, Li sought to ease fears about China's economic slowdown and stock market volatility.  Getty Images “I think if anything, the number of Chinese investors in [the Australian property] market will continue ... Our view is that property always works well in a volatile stock market environment: people seek safety in bricks and mortar,” Dan White, a director of the Ray White Group, an Australian real estate brokerage with an annual turnover in excess of 27 billion Australian dollars, that has branches in Beijing and Hong Kong, told IBTimes.

White told IBTimes he had met with 23 groups of investors on a visit to China last week, and that all were keen to pursue ongoing investment opportunities in Australia. “There's the risk that people were just being polite, but when we did throw out the option that we had buyers who would love to acquire what they had previously bought [in Australia], none of them, zero, were interested in that discussion,” he said.

Earlier this year, Australia’s foreign investment review body said China had overtaken the U.S. as the country’s biggest source of investment from overseas, with a total of AU$27.6 billion ($19.6 billion) last year, according to the Wall Street Journal.

One U.S. broker told Business Insider that she already has felt an increase in urgency among her buyers to purchase property in the U.S. before the yuan devalues further.

""Because they are insecure about the economy and the politics, with the RMB [yuan] devaluation, the stock market got mashed, and the real estate in China is a big bubble -- there is nowhere to go.""

Other brokers, however, urged caution, saying it was too soon to accurately gauge the impact of China's economic difficulties on overseas real estate.

“International property investment is a long-term trend. It is gaining momentum and has many years of growth ahead of it, quite independent of the China equities market,” Andrew Taylor, co-CEO of Juwai.com, a website that helps Chinese buyers find international property, told IBTimes in a statement.

“That said, you can make some predictions. If wealthy Chinese expect the yuan to devalue even more later this year, they may move liquid assets overseas, where they can avoid loss of value ... Many Chinese consider a New York or San Francisco apartment to be virtually deflation-proof,” he added.

A woman walks past a window of a brokerage house with stock information reflected in it, in Shanghai, Aug. 26, 2015.  Reuters/China Daily In addition to the inflow of capital, Chinese investors also have other effects on international markets. Brokers IBTimes spoke to said Chinese participation in their local markets boosted the confidence of local investors, pushing up activity and pricing. Any slowdown that dented Chinese overseas investment, therefore, would have the effect of both removing investment capital from those markets as well as denting the confidence of local investors, further limiting market activity.

In the longer term, however, if an economic malaise continues to grip China, it is likely to have knock-on effects on international real estate markets.

“I think in the majority of markets [a Chinese slowdown will have a negative impact in the long term],” said Tang.

“The sentiment is not as positive as before. Chinese investors will probably not be as aggressive as before. They want to look for more risk-averse investment opportunities, so that they are able to convert more of their RMB into offshore currency,” he added.

White agreed, saying: “If Chinese investors were to scale back on investment on its own and with the absence of any new increased demand from other sources, it would have a meaningful impact on the market and something the market would have to recover from.”

For now, at least, investors seem keen to act in accordance with an old saying reworked: When there's blood on the street -- or the trading floor -- buy property."

438,"NEW YORK, Sept. 3 (UPI) -- Crude oil prices were holding steady at the start of trading Thursday as markets weighed statements from the European Central Bank and U.S. labor figures.

European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said Thursday it was keeping key interest rates unchanged at near zero percent. While recognizing the slow recovery in the European economy, Draghi said he'd use all tools at his disposal to support growth.

Lingering concerns over the health of the Chinese economy sparked widespread volatility in global stock and commodity markets. Draghi said it was too soon to conclude whether recent trends would have long-term economic impacts on the European economy.

""Accordingly, the governing council will closely monitor all relevant incoming information,"" he said. ""It emphasizes its willingness and ability to act, if warranted, by using all the instruments available within its mandate and, in particular, recalls that the asset purchase program provides sufficient flexibility in terms of adjusting the size, composition and duration of the program.""

Crude oil prices moved up very modestly at the start of trading in New York. The global benchmark Brent and the U.S. benchmark, West Texas Intermediate, were relatively unchanged from the previous close to trade at $50.53 per barrel and $46.37 per barrel, respectively.

Oil prices moved lower in Wednesday trading after Eurostat, the European Union's statistics office, reported industrial producer prices fell 2.1 percent year-on-year in July and were down 0.1 percent from the previous month. For energy, prices fell 6.5 percent year-on-year and were down 0.5 percent from June.

Lower demand from weakened economies, coupled with a market favoring the supply side, is pushing crude oil prices to historic lows, down more than 50 percent from June 2014 levels.

The U.S. Labor Department, meanwhile, said initial claims for unemployment increased 12,000 for a seasonally adjusted 282,000 for the week ending Aug. 29. Last week's claims were revised down by 1,000, however, and long-term trends show a steady decline in unemployment."

 The revised draft of the Indian Financial Code (IFC), released by the Finance Ministry last month, had suggested doing away with RBI Governor's veto power and wants a 7-member MPC to take decisions by a majority vote. Of the seven members, four would be government nominees and the rest from the RBI.



 Reports suggest the consensus arrived at between the government and the RBI is for a six-member committee with equal representation from each side and the Governor having the casting vote.



 Under the current system, the Reserve Bank Governor is appointed by the government, but controls monetary policy and has veto power over the existing advisory committee of RBI members and outside appointees that sets rates."

“The board of directors has considered and approved the scheme of amalgamation...between Bijli Holdings, based on the recommendation of the audit committee,” the company said in a BSE filing.

The purpose of the amalgamation is to simplify the shareholding structure of PVR and reduce the shareholding tiers. It also envisages to demonstrate Bijli Holdings’ direct engagement with PVR, the filing said.

“Bijli Holdings is part of the promoter group of PVR. Post-amalgamation, paid-up capital of the company will remain the same and there shall be no dilution for any shareholders, including public shareholders,” PVR said.

After the amalgamation, individual promoters will directly hold shares in PVR and there will be no change in the total promoters’ shareholding of PVR. The total promoters’ shareholding is 26.33 per cent of PVR’s paid-up equity share capital.

2319,"As if they didn't have enough to fight about already, the Big Brother housemates will almost certainly be reeling after learning that reports of their respective fees have been leaked. And to make matters worse there's a sizeable disparity in the salaries they have each been paid for living under the glare of the cameras 24/7 for public consumption.

America's Next Top Model judge and former supermodel Janice Dickinson has reportedly been paid £300,000 for her presence in the iconic Elstree compound, while the other housemates are commanding figures closer to the £100k mark.

Bobby Davro and Atomic Kitten singer Natasha Hamilton are reportedly looking at earning a paltry £75,000 a piece, while X Factor rejects Stevi Richie and Chloe Jasmine have fared considerably better, pocketing a six-figure sum between them.

Tila Tequila, meanwhile, left the house with nothing, forfeiting her £110,000 fee after a two-year old photo of the model dressed as a Nazi emerged. She has since isued an apology and reportedly threatened to sue the show for her fee, eventhough she only managed to spend one day in the house .

Dickinson, who is famed for speaking her mind, joined the house along with comedian Davro, a day after the launch event and wasted no time making her presence felt. The 60-year-old, who also appeared in I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here!, has already been given a formal warning for 'pretending' to spit on Austin Armacost.

But while she has already more than earned her fee after her explosive spats with her fellow housemates, she is by no means the highest earning housemate the show has seen.By comparison Katie Price, the winner of the last series, took home a cool half a million, while 'Britain's most hated woman' Katie Hopkins, was paid a reported £400,000. Hopkins also went on to carve a lucrative, though somewhat questionable TV career off the back of Big Brother.

Channel 5 have declined to comment on reports of the leaked salaries.

1441,"Canada fell into a recession in the first half of the year as its economy reeled from the impact of low oil prices.

According to Statistics Canada, the economy contracted 0.5 per cent in the second quarter after retreating 0.8 per cent in the previous three months.

Canada's second recession in seven years came as the latest GDP figures out of similarly resource-reliant Australia confirmed a sharp decline in growth and saw the Australian dollar dip below 70 US cents.

Prime minister Stephen Harper, whose Conservatives are trailing their rivals in opinion polls ahead of an October 19 election, blamed the ""ongoing global economic instability"" for Canada's woes.

""Obviously there have been challenges, particularly in the energy and some commodity sectors because of falling prices,"" Mr Harper said.

""But the fact of the matter is over 80 per cent of the Canadian economy has been growing.""

Canada, the world's fifth-largest oil producer, has been hit particularly hard by the halving of world oil prices from above $US100 last year.

In the second quarter, its mining, quarrying and oil and gas extraction sector posted a ""notable decrease"" for a second consecutive quarter, Statistics Canada said.

One key question is whether Australia, where iron ore and coal industries are also at the mercy of supply gluts and collapsing prices, could be next.

The official measure of Western Australia's economy, excluding exports, has fallen for six consecutive quarters.

Queensland's has fallen three of the past five, and the Northern Territory fell last quarter.

Andrew Charlton, a former economic adviser for the Rudd government, said Australia and Canada ""now have a number of common problems"".

""Australia used to have resources and energy being about a third of our exports and that rose over the last 10 years to more than half of our exports, and we saw broadly the same thing in Canada,"" he told The Business.

""We have declining terms of trade, we have declining national income, per capita at least - and we have this legacy of very high house prices which is going to be continue to be fuelled by very low monetary policy.""

But while Canada's exports are split between the slowing Chinese economy and a recovering US, Australia is tied to China.

Mr Charlton is sceptical of China's debt-fuelled growth, led by massive infrastructure and dwelling construction, and likens it to post-war Japan, or even the Soviet Union under Stalin.

""The consequence of very high levels of investment in an economy is often short-term growth, followed by over-investment, capital overhang, often debt problems in market based economies and then a long period of stagnation,"" he said.

Due to the high Canadian and Australian dollars, there is not much to fill the hole left by the commodity bust.

""Export markets don't snap back. There are challenges and fixed costs in creating export markets - in Australia that's in services, in manufactures - and once you lose those markets it's hard to get them back,"" Mr Charlton said.

That has left central banks in both countries to do the heavy lifting, slashing interest rates to lower their currencies and boost domestic demand.

Canada's official cash rate is well below Australia's at just 0.5 per cent.

But the only thing low rates have lifted are the housing markets, with bubble trouble in Sydney and Melbourne mirrored in Canada's biggest cities.

""Residential housing is the one industry in Canada that is doing quite well right now,"" said Canadian economist Mike Moffatt.

But while home building is propping up Australia's economy, Canada's housing boom has failed to offset the commodities bust.

However, analysts said the damage to Canada's economy could be limited.

""Despite the weak start to the year, there is good reason to believe that the worst is over,"" TD economist Brian DePratto told the AFP news agency.

He cited the sharp increase in GDP in June, ""providing positive momentum to start the second half of the year"".

Mr DePratto predicted a ""sharp rebound"" in the third quarter with growth reaching 2.5 per cent by year's end."

At the Jackson Hole Summit, White and a group of rebel economists gathered to discuss the topic of whether or not central banks are the problem or the solution to America’s financial woes.

Professor White is an advocate of “free banking,” which is the Austrian economic system of ending the Federal Reserve and allowing the free market to regulate the supply of money in the marketplace. We don’t allow government to set the price of bread, gas, or cars… so why do we allow them to set the price of money?

Professor White believes that money has become controlled by political interests, and thinks that the free market can more effectively allow for stable economic growth, without all the booms and busts of the modern era.

Ian Rogers, former CEO of Beats Music, oversaw Apple's Beats1 online radio service which Apple launched after purchasing Beats for $3 billion last year.

Apple said that at least 11 million people signed up for Beats' free three-month trial, with the first batch of those users having to decide whether to pay to keep using the service at the end of September.

Apple has said that it has a 79% retention rate for Beats1, according to tech website The Verge, but industry analyst MusicWatch puts the  retention rate at just 48%.

Beats1 radio uses high profile celebrities and DJ's to curate music for its subscribers and the service has received critical acclaim, according to Re/code.

Separately, TheStreet Ratings team rates APPLE INC as a Buy with a ratings score of B+. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation:

""We rate APPLE INC (AAPL) a BUY. This is driven by a number of strengths, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its solid stock price performance, impressive record of earnings per share growth, compelling growth in net income, robust revenue growth and notable return on equity. Although no company is perfect, currently we do not see any significant weaknesses which are likely to detract from the generally positive outlook.""

1746,"Spain’s economy minister says his country is a winner from the plunge in oil prices and is well insulated from the Chinese slowdown that’s partly driving the decline.

In a Bloomberg Television interview in Madrid, Luis de Guindos said lower energy costs for consumers and companies are helping to drive an acceleration in Spain’s expansion this year. The economy grew 1 percent in the second quarter, more than three times the euro-area average.

“We import the majority of the commodities, especially in the case of energy,” de Guindos said in the interview in Madrid on Wednesday. “So for Spain it’s a gain-gain situation.”

The government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy forecasts growth of 3.3 percent this year, buoyed by lower energy costs, interest rates close to record lows and a weaker currency. The decline in oil prices alone means a saving of 10 billion euros ($11.1 billion) -- that will boost disposable income for households and lower costs for companies, de Guindos said.

Spain isn’t directly affected by the lower growth in China because only 2 percent of exports go to that country, according to the minister. Nevertheless, he’s alert to the risks of a spillover to other emerging markets and the global economy that could hurt Spain.

“The slowdown of the Chinese economy is going to have spillover effects on other emerging markets and for Spain, for instance, the exposure to Latin America is quite relevant,” de Guindos said. “That could be the detrimental part.”

While cheap fuel and money is helping to propel Spanish growth, the government has also played its part by pushing through reforms such as making labor regulations more flexible, he said. In his view, growth would be threatened if elections due later this year led to a new administration that stalled or rolled back on those. Rajoy said Thursday the vote would be held in December.

“Reversing the reforms is the main risk,” de Guindos said. “It’s a political risk.”

On the euro exchange rate, the minister said a level of about $1.15 represents “fair value.” He also noted that about 60 percent of Spain’s foreign sales go to other nations in the currency bloc and even when the euro was at $1.40, exports were growing."
582,"Vice President Yemi Osinbajo regretted yesterday that even though Nigeria has recorded remarkable rise   in oil prices, GDP and foreign reserves during the last three presidencies, unemployment has also   remained on the rise at the same time.

This, he said, was a clear indication that such figures, including a rise in revenue by itself as   were bandied by the administrations of former Presidents Olusegun Obasanjo, Umar Yar’Adua and Goodluck Jonathan does not create jobs or significantly put a dent to poverty levels in the   country.

Osinbajo made this observation, while speaking at the ongoing 45th Annual Accounting Conference of   the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria, in Abuja on the topic: “Repositioning Nigeria for   Sustainable Development: From Rhetoric to Performance”.

He said, while there are indeed seemingly good growth figures, such figures “can be deceptive where the structure and quality of growth are not considered.

“So why are most (of our people) poor despite rising revenues and GDP growth? Our main revenue   earners, the extractive oil and gas economy, do not by themselves create many jobs”, the VP noted.

He added that such is the “irony of a top-down economic model, when the major revenue earner is   extractive and the value chain is poorly developed.”

Identifying the way forward from the present economic challenges, Osinbajo who made a comparative analysis of the previous administrations called for social sector investment – investing in the people, education, job creation, national school feeding scheme, conditional cash transfer and reflating economies of the States as indices that would boost the economy.

He added that these ideas had already been put in place by the Buhari administration, including the   bailout package for the workers in the country, and some others are currently being worked out.

The Vice President, however, reiterated that education is the basics for economic development, saying “One of the most important interventions required in the education sector is capacity building to improve teacher quality.

“This programme is intended to drive teacher capacity development; boost basic education; attract talents to the teaching profession. Better educated population increase economic potential for productivity”, he noted."
482,"In an announcement, the Chinese central bank has mentioned that it had tainted the way it computed the currency's daily midpoint against the greenback, now taking the midpoint from market-makers quotes and the previous day's closing price. The reflection of USDCNY fixing rate has been adverse on spot FX trading. The USDCNY fixing rate is up higher by 1.9%, the largest adjustment on record, reflecting a major change in the determination of the exchange rate, citing sharp REER appreciation and spot deviation from fix as PBoC's currency management mechanism to reflect where spot CNY is trading, as a result we reckon that the risks are much higher for further CNY depreciation.

 

 China's spot Yuan fell nearly 2% in early trading sessions today heading towards its biggest daily crash ever. The Yuan was quoted at 6.3080 versus the dollar in early trade, weakening from 6.2097 at the closed on Monday. It fell 0.7 percent during the global financial crisis in December 2008. With expectations of this outcome likely to drive FX forward points higher and intensify hedging activities.

 

 Moreover, we go on with belief that supply-demand dynamics will remain constructive for higher rates in the CNH CCS market. We think expectations of a weaker RMB should lead to increased demand for hedging of RMB-denominated assets or cash flows, as observed in today's kneejerk reaction in front-end forwards - 1s CNY has moved 3% compared to the 1.9% change in fix. Moreover, this is likely to reduce global investors' appetite for 'Dim Sum' bonds, which comes at a time when maturities of these bonds are rather light (CNH38.2bn of maturities in Q2 vs an estimated CNH15.6bn in Q3).

 

 Thus, a likely decrease in Dim Sum bond issuance and hedging flows, which supported the market through Q2 15, should mean little resistance to a move higher in CNH CCS. Moreover, we think that market positioning is skewed towards being short USDCNH, hence, a likely slow down of which may extra impact the market beyond today's hasty reaction."
49,"The 15th consecutive season of SEC on CBS football kicks off Saturday with No. 6 Auburn taking on Louisville in the annual Chick-Fil-A Kickoff Game, the first of 17 matchups set to be aired by the network this fall as part of an expanded 2015 SEC on CBS slate. Here's everything you need to know about the Tigers' date with the Cardinals.

When: Saturday, Sept. 5, 3:30 p.m. ET | Where: Georgia Dome -- Atlanta, Ga.

On the call: Verne Lundquist (play-by-play), Gary Danielson (color commentary). The 2015 is the 10th consecutive year that Lundquist and Danielson have partnered to call SEC on CBS games.

History: Second meeting; Auburn leads the all-time ""series"" 1-0, defeating Louisville 16-3 in 1974*.

At stake: Not many of Louisville's goals would be dashed by an expected Week 1 nonconference loss to a top-10 opponent, which may helpfully let Bobby Petrino's team perform without much in the way of pressure. For an Auburn team picked by the media to win the SEC and chosen by many to claim a College Football Playoff berth, however, an opening-week loss as a double-digit favorite would all-but-eliminate the Tigers' 2015 margin for error before their season even really begins.

Storyline: After Gene Chizik was dismissed in 2012, the coach many Auburn fans wanted to hire (and the coach Auburn reportedly considered) before opting for Gus Malzahn was ... Bobby Petrino, a former Tigers assistant himself who'd been at the center of Auburn's infamous ""Jetgate"" scandal in 2003. Maybe the Tigers and Cardinals don't have much on-field backstory, but that's not the case for Auburn and Louisville's coach. Can Petrino write another awkward chapter in the two sides' shared history?

Advantage -- Auburn: throwing the ball on first and second down. The Cards should be fearsome on third-and-long defensively with star end Sheldon Rankins and ballyhooed (for good reason) TCU transfer Devonte Fields capable of getting to the passer against just about anyone. But if Malzahn can catch the Cards front seven thinking rush on early downs, he'll have big-armed quarterback Jeremy Johnson, potential All-SEC target Duke Williams, and the rest of the Tiger wideouts matching up unimpeded against a Louisville secondary that's replacing all four starters from a year ago. Expect big plays to follow.

Advantage -- Louisville: giving Petrino extra time to prepare. Particularly after seeing a whopping 10 players taken in the 2015 NFL Draft, second only to Florida State's 11, Louisville doesn't have any area other than the front seven where they can equal Auburn for raw, on-paper talent. But that doesn't much matter where a Petrino offense is concerned, especially not when he's got multiple quality candidates at quarterback** and faces an Auburn defense that -- for all the ample potential at Will Muschamp's disposal -- has spent years struggling mightily against well-drilled passing attacks. No. 1 receiver James Quick should have an explosive start to his season.

Advantage -- (to be determined): stopping each other's ground game. If no one's going to doubt Auburn's rushing capabilities after Malzahn's first couple of years in charge, it's only fair to extend that same lack of doubt to the Cardinals' front seven. Lorenzo Mauldin's moved on, but linemen Rankins, DeAngelo Brown and Pio Vatuvei are back, along with terrific linebacking tandem James Burgess and Keith Kelsey. That's already the foundation for one of the country's best run-stopping units, and that's before we discuss what Fields might bring to the table. Even for Auburn, rushing straight ahead against the Cards could make for rough sledding.

The downside for Louisville? The sledding might be even rougher on the other side. Auburn's got no shortage of front seven talent of its own in former five-star junior linemen Carl Lawson and Montravius Adams, as well as senior linebackers Cassanova McKinzy and Kris Frost. And unlike a Tigers offensive line that enjoyed plenty of success last season and returns several key pieces, the Cards' O-line struggled badly at times -- finishing 103rd in FBS yards-per-carry -- and returns just 19 career starts. Even a Petrino offense can't win going one-dimensional for 60 minutes, and Auburn might have an even better shot at forcing that one-dimensionality than Louisville does.

One stat to know: Johnson's 78 career attempts don't represent much of a sample size, especially with many of them coming in garbage time or against FCS competition. Still: among all active FBS players with at least 75 attempts, Johnson ranks first in career completion percentage (73.1), yards per attempt (11.0), touchdown percentage (11.5) and QB rating (198.4). Auburn fans aren't giddy over the junior's sky-high ceiling for nothing.

The prediction: Petrino did excellent work in getting the Cards to 9-4 in his first year with the program, but none of those victories came over ranked opposition; Louisville lost by 11 to Florida State and by 23 to Georgia in their only two games against top 25 teams. In Auburn and Malzahn, Petrino's facing an opponent with roughly similar talent to the 'Noles and Dawgs and offensive coaching acumen to rival his own. Though the Cards' ability to slow down Malzahn's running game should keep things close, eventually the Tigers' greater offensive balance and top-to-bottom depth should take its toll. Auburn 35, Louisville 24

* Though Auburn was the home team for that game, the Tigers chose to play the game at Birmingham's Legion Field -- meaning neither of the teams' first two meetings will take place in either Auburn or Louisville.

** Petrino has steadfastly refused to give any indication which of Reggie Bonnafon, Will Gardner, Kyle Bolin or Lamar Jackson will get the start against the Tigers, with all four listed as co-starters on the initial depth chart."

Now that Week 1 of the 2015 college football season is upon us, several programs will start their quest to end that lull and knock Ohio State off its lofty perch.

Others will either try to make a leap to another level or battle into a bowl game.

While it isn't a week full of top-10 showdowns, a few teams have some strong early-season tests at neutral-site venues. A couple of them will match up teams that are ranked in B/R's preseason top 25 poll.

No. 4 Alabama must play 21st-ranked Wisconsin in Dallas in one of the marquee games of the first week. Everybody will get a taste of whether No. 25 Texas A&M is a contender or pretender in a showdown with the 16th-ranked Arizona State Sun Devils.

Before all that, on Thursday, there's the battle of the Carolinas between the Gamecocks and Tar Heels in Charlotte.

Other teams play tough lower-tier programs, and then there's the usual slate of early-season cupcakes to iron the kinks out of teams (against Skyhawks, Warhawks and Redhawks, etc. No, seriously).

Look east for the dip in oil prices

VIOLENT swings in oil prices are destabilising economies and financial markets worldwide. When the oil price halved last year, from $110 to $55 a barrel, the cause was obvious: Saudi Arabia’s decision to increase its share of the global oil market by expanding production.

But what accounts for the further plunge in oil prices in the past few weeks — to lows last seen in the immediate aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis — and how will it affect the world economy?

The standard explanation is weak Chinese demand, with the oil-price collapse widely regarded as a portent of recession, either in China or for the entire global economy. But this is almost certainly wrong, even though it seems to be confirmed by the tight correlation between oil and equity markets, which have fallen to their lowest levels since 2009 not only in China, but also in Europe and most emerging economies.

The predictive significance of oil prices is indeed impressive, but only as a contrary indicator: falling oil prices have never correctly predicted an economic downturn. On all recent occasions when the price of oil was halved — 1982-83, 1985-86, 1992-93, 1997-98, and 2001-02 — faster global growth followed.

Conversely, every global recession in the past 50 years has been preceded by a sharp increase in oil prices. Most recently, the price of oil almost tripled, from $50 to $140, in the year leading up to the 2008 crash; it then fell to $40 in the six months before the recovery that started in April 2009.

An important corollary for commodity-producing developing countries is that industrial metal prices, which really are leading indicators of economic activity, may well increase after an oil-price collapse. In 1986-87, for example, metal prices doubled a year after oil prices fell by half.

A powerful economic mechanism underlies the inverse correlation between oil prices and global growth. Because the world burns 34-billion barrels of oil every year, a $10 fall in the price shifts $340bn from oil producers to consumers. Thus, the $60 price decline since last August will redistribute more than $2-trillion annually to oil consumers, providing a bigger income boost than the combined US and Chinese fiscal stimulus in 2009.

Because oil consumers generally spend extra income fairly quickly, while governments usually maintain public spending by borrowing or running down reserves, the net effect of lower oil prices has always been positive for global growth. According to the International Monetary Fund, the fall in oil prices this year should boost 2016 gross domestic product by 0.5%-1% globally, including growth of 0.3%-0.4% in Europe, 1%-1.2% in the US and 1%-2% in China.

But if growth is likely to accelerate next year in oil-consuming economies such as China, what explains plunging oil prices? The answer lies not in China’s economy and oil demand, but in Middle East geopolitics and oil supply.

While Saudi production policies were clearly behind last year’s halving of the oil price, the latest plunge began on July 6, within days of the deal to lift international sanctions against Iran. The Iran nuclear deal refuted the widespread but naive assumption that geopolitics can drive oil prices in only one direction. Traders suddenly recalled that geopolitical events can increase oil supplies, not just reduce them — and that further geopolitics-driven supply boosts are likely in the years ahead.

Conditions in Libya, Russia, Venezuela and Nigeria are already so bad that further damage to their oil output is hard to imagine. On the contrary, with so many of the world’s most productive oil regions gripped by political chaos, any sign of stabilisation can quickly boost supplies. That is what happened in Iraq last year, and Iran is now taking this process to a higher level.

Once sanctions are lifted, Iran promises to double oil exports almost immediately to 2-million barrels daily, and then to double exports again by the end of the decade. To do this, Iran would have to boost its total output (including domestic consumption) to 6-million barrels a day, roughly equal to its peak output in the 1970s. Given the enormous advances in oil-extraction technology since the 1970s and the immense size of Iran’s reserves (the fourth-largest in the world, after Saudi Arabia, Russia, and Venezuela), restoring output to the levels of 40 years ago seems a modest objective.

To find buyers for all this extra oil, roughly equal to the extra output produced by the US shale revolution, Iran will have to compete fiercely not only with Saudi Arabia, but also with Iraq, Kazakhstan, Russia and other low-cost producers. All of these countries are also determined to restore their output to previous peak levels and should be able to pump more oil than they did in the 1970s and 1980s by exploiting new production technologies pioneered in the US.

In this newly competitive environment, oil will trade like any normal commodity, with the Saudi monopoly broken and North American production costs setting a long-term price ceiling of about $50 a barrel, for reasons that I set out in January.

So, if you want to understand falling oil prices, forget about Chinese consumption and focus on Middle East production. And if you want to understand the world economy, forget about stock markets and focus on the fact that cheap oil always boosts global growth. © Project Syndicate, 2015. www.project-syndicate.org

""The SEC is now more than four years past the deadline set by Congress for the promulgation of the final rule,"" Casper wrote in her decision.

""The court concludes...that the SEC's delay in promulgating the final extractive payments disclosure rule can be considered unlawfully withheld.""

Oxfam has been among one of the most vocal supporters of the resource extraction rule, saying it will play a crucial role in helping combat corruption in resource-rich countries.

Required by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law, the rule calls for oil, gas and mining companies to disclose how much they pay governments in taxes, royalties and other types of fees for exploration, extraction and other activities.

The SEC did complete work on the rule in August 2012, a few months after Oxfam first sued the SEC over delays.

But the non-stop litigation surrounding the rule did not end after the SEC adopted it.

Trade groups including the Chamber of Commerce and the American Petroleum Institute filed a lawsuit accusing the SEC of conducting a flawed analysis of the rule's costs to the industry. In 2013, a federal judge tossed the rule out, saying it was ""arbitrary and capricious.""

The SEC did not appeal the decision, and vowed to go back and rewrite the rule from scratch. To date, no new rule has been proposed.

Frustrated with the delays, Oxfam sued the SEC for the second time in September 2014.

An SEC spokeswoman said the agency is reviewing the decision. (Reporting by Sarah N. Lynch; Editing by Marguerita Choy)"
1920,"The U.S Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has revealed that the former owner and Chief Executive Officer of Millennium Capital Exchange, Inc., Stafford S. Maxwell, was sentenced to almost four years in prison for orchestrating a multi-million dollar foreign exchange market Ponzi scheme.

According to United States Attorney John Horn, in March 2007 Maxwell incorporated and owned Millennium Capital Exchange, Inc., as an FX trading firm. From about 2008 to January 2012, Maxwell solicited investments with promises of high fixed rates of return to be generated from successful trading. Maxwell falsely stated that he possessed excellent forex trading skills and that he had a long history of forex trading success.

“With false promises of trading success, Maxwell defrauded investors across the country out of more than $2 million,” said Horn. “To those tempted by investment schemes that seem too good to be true—be cautious—because promises of high rates of return are often red flags for fraud.”

According to documents presented to the court, Maxwell often assured investors that they would earn an annualized rate of return on their investments from approximately 48% to 72%! (An obvious warning sign to anyone with a minimal understanding of trading or basic math.)

The trading strategy Maxwell claimed to use was to place “stops” and “floors” on trades to ensure that the gains would be large, but that the losses would be small. He additionally claimed that past investors had realized significant gains based on his trading and that he had reserve funds enabling him to cover any possible trading losses.

According to the FBI however, Maxwell had little success executing forex trades and lost almost all the money that he traded on. He was also unable to pay investors the promised investment dividends as he possessed no reserve fund to cover trading losses.

Britt Johnson, Special Agent in Charge, FBI Atlanta Field Office, stated: “The FBI continues to see such investment based fraud cases that offer their investors high rates of returns with minimum or no risk. While many of the victim investors are still trying to recover financially, it is hoped that they find some solace in today’s sentencing of Mr. Maxwell to federal prison.”

According to Millennium’s business model, Maxwell was supposed to use the invested funds to trade through accounts at an unnamed financial firm in Geneva, Switzerland. Based on his false representations, investors wired Maxwell over $2 million, expecting that the funds would be traded in the Swiss accounts.

After receiving money from investors, however, Maxwell diverted approximately half of the money for other improper purposes. Firstly, in an effort to perpetuate the scheme and make it appear that he was a successful forex trader, Maxwell used the money received from new investors to pay “dividends” to older investors- the very definition of a Ponzi scheme.

Secondly, Maxwell used the money received from investors to pay his own personal living expenses. In the end, Maxwell spent or lost almost every dollar invested with him.

On March 17, 2015, Maxwell was indicted on 10 counts of conspiratorial and substantive wire fraud. He pleaded guilty to all the charges on June 29, 2015. On Wednesday, Maxwell was sentenced to three years, nine months in prison and was ordered to pay approximately $1,434,628 in restitution to his victims."
742,"As growth in the world’s second-largest economy slows and China’s stock market sits nearly 39% below its June high, people are asking how closely correlated the two are.

In a video posted to Charles Schwab Corp.’s website, Jeffrey Kleintop, the firm’s chief global investment strategist, told viewers there is no correlation between the two.

“Over the last 20 years there has been no correlation between China’s stock market and its economy,” he said. “Statistically it’s 0.00.”

Mr. Kleintop noted that in many countries the stock market is a leading indicator of the economy, which would suggest that a selloff in equities could portend deceleration in China’s growth.

Concerns over China’s growth have already weighed on global markets with the S&P 500 tumbling into correction territory, more than 10% from its recent high, and volatility popping to its highest level since 2009 near the end of August.

But with China’s stock market and economy showing no correlation, Mr. Kleintop sought to assuage worries about the Shanghai Composite’s turbulence being an omen about a drop off in growth.

The World Bank estimates that a one percentage-point decline in China’s growth cuts half of a percentage point off of global growth. Beijing’s official statistics show expansion of 7% in the second quarter, but economists widely doubt China grew at that clip.

The International Monetary Fund said Wednesday that China’s slowdown, plus a host of other downside risks, threaten to push down global growth without concerted action by the world’s largest economies.

In July, the IMF projected the global economy will expand 3.3% this year. But Tuesday Managing Director Christine Lagarde said the IMF plans to downgrade its forecast again, putting its latest outlook due in October below what was already the weakest since the financial crisis.

Expansion of 3.3% is certainly no recession and it would only mark a slight cool down from the 3.4% world growth the IMF recorded in 2014.

Still, Mr. Kleintop said the volatility that’s spread throughout the markets “may be here to stay” as the Federal Reserve moves toward raising interest rates at a time when other global central bankers are easing to help spur growth."

2252,"The Haggen grocery chain, which announced this month that it is closing five of 10 newly opened stores in Arizona, filed a $1 billion lawsuit against Albertsons on Tuesday, accusing it of undermining the successful launch of Haggen's new stores in five states.

Haggen claimed in a federal lawsuit that Albertsons violated antitrust laws by using the Bellingham, Wash.-based regional grocery store chain to help gain the Federal Trade Commission's approval of its merger with Safeway this year and then engaging in ""coordinated and systematic efforts to eliminate competition.""

Albertsons was supposed to divest 130 stores to foster local competition as part of the $9.2 billion merger, which created the one of the largest grocery store chains in the United States, with 2,200 stores and $61 billion in combined sales, according to the complaint.

In the lawsuit, Haggen claimed that Albertsons lied to the FTC and launched an illegal campaign ""intended to prevent and delay the successful entry of Haggen ... into local grocery markets that Albertsons now dominates.”

Representatives of Alberstons denied the allegations on Tuesday.

“The allegations in the lawsuit are completely without merit,"" said Nancy Keane, a public affairs and government relations spokeswoman for Albertsons Safeway and Vons.

Albertsons accused Haggen of fraud in a July lawsuit for $41 million. Albertsons contends Haggen refused to pay for inventory at 38 stores.

Haggen said it was forced to close 27 of the stores that it bought as a part of the Albertsons’ divestiture, and could close more. It claimed in its suit that Albertsons ""critically damaged the operations, customer service, brand goodwill and profitability of the divested stores from the outset.""

Haggen said Albertsons engaged in an illegal campaign that included “premeditated acts of unfair and anti-competitive conduct that were calculated to circumvent Albertsons obligations under federal antitrust laws, FTC orders, and contractual commitments to Haggen.""

Haggen is controlled by Comvest Partners, a private investment firm that owns a majority of the company's stock shares. Comvest provides equity and debt capital to business across the country. It has invested more than $2 billion in more than 140 public and private companies and has assets totaling more than $1.8 billion.

Haggen's purchase of 146 Albertsons and Safeway stores in December instantly changed its profile from a local Pacific Northwest regional market with 18 stores to a major national chain with 164 stores and 106 pharmacies in Arizona, California, Nevada, Oregon and Washington.

But two weeks ago, Haggen announced it would close five Arizona stores and 22 others in California, Washington and Oregon over the next two months.

Officials said in a statement last month that the closures were part of a move to improve business and strengthen the company’s competitive position. They did not say how many jobs will be lost as a result of the closures.

“Haggen’s goal going forward is to ensure a stable, healthy company that will benefit our customers, associates, vendors, creditors, stakeholders as well as the communities we serve,” Bill Shaner, chief executive officer of Haggen’s Pacific Southwest division, said in the statement.

In a statement on the lawsuit Tuesday, Haggen laid blame for the store closures squarely on Albertsons.

“During the transfer process, Albertsons launched its plan to gain market power and/or monopoly power, acting in a manner that was designed to (and did) hamstring Haggen’s ability to successfully operate the stores after taking ownership,” the statement said, adding that Alberstons ""caused significant harm to competition, local communities, employees and consumers.”

Haggen said Albertsons violated the FTC order and purchase agreement through a series of acts that “created substantial distraction and diverted the attention of store-level and senior Haggen management” during the conversion process. Those included:

The lawsuit said instead of focusing on new store openings, “Haggen has had to focus on strategies to recover from Albertsons’ wrongful acts, which include, sadly, Haggen’s efforts to find new jobs for displaced employees."""
124,"3. Drivers of low inflation in the euro area: domestic or external?

4. The Phillips curve as a vehicle to discuss inflation dynamics:

a) Measuring the economic slack, the slope and its stability;

b) Are hybrid New Keynesian Phillips curves useful in understanding inflation dynamics?

c) Stability of the coefficients of inflation inertia, economic activity, inflation expectations and external prices. Limitations of the Phillips curve and the need to use several different models.

5. Lessons for monetary policy: the use of models and judgement to understand, forecast and design policies to influence medium-term inflation. Achieving the inflation target in the euro area.

It is a great pleasure to participate in this policy panel with such distinguished fellow participants. In my remarks today I will discuss the general difficulties in dealing with inflation dynamics, but I will concentrate on the recent developments in euro area inflation and discuss their implications for monetary policy.

Understanding inflation dynamics has become particularly important in view of the low inflation regime now prevailing and because the traditional relationship between slack in the economy and inflation seems to have weakened significantly in some countries.

If confirmed, the flattening of the Phillips curve would be relevant for monetary policy because that relationship was the traditional linchpin of the transmission mechanism that gave central banks control of inflation. The subsequent focus on the role of expectations and their management in the toolkit of monetary policy reduced but did not eliminate the relevance of that traditional mechanism. In 2006 both the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Federal Reserve started to highlight a decade-long decline in the slope of the Phillips curve, i.e. the coefficient of economic slack (IMF (2006), Iakova (2007) and Roberts (2006)). This decline has been challenged by Gordon (2007 and 2013) as being too dependent on the Phillips curve specification, being particularly associated with variants of the New Keynesian Phillips curve (NKPC), but not verified by Gordon’s own “triangle model”. Coibion and Gorodnichenko (2015) show that evidence of slope decline is mixed for the United States. Stock and Watson (2010) say that “there are some hints that the slope parameter might be smaller at low levels of inflation but these hints are not robustly confirmed by statistical tests”. Stella and Stock (2012) even find signs of a steepening of the Phillips curve for the United States.

More important, however, was the emergence, after the Great Recession, of a twin puzzle: first, missing disinflation in 2009-11, and second, excessive disinflation after 2012, particularly in Europe. During the Great Recession (the recession that followed the financial crisis), inflation in advanced countries did not fall as much as a traditional Phillips curve and past experiences would have predicted, given the severity and length of the recession (Williams (2010) and Ball and Mazumder (2011)). Just as puzzling, more recent global developments point in the opposite direction, since, in spite of the ongoing recovery, headline inflation rates in advanced (and a few emerging market) economies remain below target. Clearly, one reason for the low inflation rates is the recent large decline in oil prices. But core or underlying rates of inflation have also been below average almost everywhere. The seemingly weakened relationship between inflation and economic slack in the cases of the two puzzles seemed to have disposed of the Phillips curve. We will see why that is not true after all.

Ex-post, we are not in the dark: If we exploit all available information we can recover the dynamics of inflation after the fact fairly well, and rationalise inflation developments after the financial crisis. For the euro area we can identify two distinct periods of disinflation in the case of HICP excluding energy and food: the first from 2008 to 2010 and the second starting in 2012. The analysis is based on a Bayesian VAR [2] which includes HICP excluding energy and food, real activity indicators (real GDP, the unemployment rate and real investment), external variables (NEER, non-energy commodity prices, oil price in US dollars and foreign demand) and financial variables (short-term interest rates lending rates and real loans to non-financial corporations).

Each inflation dip had different origins: the first was mainly due to external factors (falling energy and food prices), while the second was driven more by domestic sources in an environment of weak demand.

There is a vast body of literature on the first puzzle of the “missing disinflation”, which offers a variety of explanations: the increased anchoring of expectations by a credible monetary policy (Bernanke (2010) and IMF (2013)); the continued decline of the responsiveness to economic slack (IMF (2013)); the increased downward wage rigidities in a recession that bend the wage Phillips curve (Daly and Hobijn (2014)); the higher forward-looking expectations of marginal costs in a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model (Del Negro, Giannoni and Schorfheide (2015)); a fall in total factor productivity and increased costs of working capital (Christiano, Eichenbaum and Trabandt (2014)); a regime switch in the slope explained by sticky prices and sticky information (Murphy (2014)); or the role of higher mark-ups of liquidity-constrained firms (Gilchrist, Schoenle, Sim, and Zakrajsek (2015)). Others pointed to important measurement issues and suggested e.g. using short-term unemployment to measure slack (Gordon (2013), Krueger et al. (2014) and Ball and Mazumder (2014)) or household expectations from surveys to relevantly measure inflation expectations (Coibion and Gorodnichenko (2015)).

Most of these approaches, besides solving the puzzle a posteriori, also provide new methods that promise to improve future inflation forecasting, even in the context of reduced-form Phillips curves. The use of short-term unemployment [3] or household inflation expectations that are closer to those of economic agents, are two examples of promising developments. It is also helpful to introduce time-varying coefficients or regime-switching estimates, to account for many possible sources of non-linearity in the Phillips curve.

For headline inflation, external supply shocks, for example in commodity prices, have played a significant role but the two highlighted puzzles also apply to core inflation. Very importantly, the trend for a weaker relationship with economic slack applies also to core inflation. Most of the papers I have cited use the consumer price index (CPI) without energy and food or the GDP deflator as inflation variables. Only a few also use headline inflation. Core inflation reflects mostly domestic factors, as indirect effects from external developments are muted and take time to operate. That is why I consider it more useful to focus on core inflation dynamics for the purpose of discussing their consequences for monetary policy.

Despite a few dissenters, the majority view in these papers is favourable to the idea that the slope of economic slack has declined. There are several possible explanations:

1. The increased anchoring of inflation expectations makes inflation less sensitive to economic activity.

2. Higher import volumes as a result of increased globalization have also increased the importance of international prices relative to domestic prices, forcing domestic mark-ups to be less sensitive to the state of the domestic economy.

3. Also as a result of globalization, inflation across countries displays an important common factor that explains a substantial part of the national inflation variation. Ciccarelli and Mojon (2010) and Ferroni and Mojon (2014) show that the commonality of inflation goes beyond what can be captured by commodity prices. They also report that the global inflation factor would improve forecasts of domestic inflation in different specifications, from augmenting an AR (1) model to using it in Phillips curves or BVARs. Further, they demonstrate that the importance of the common factor does not depend on spillovers among countries but is more the result of common shocks and convergence of monetary policy frameworks around the world. Confirming these results, Medel, Pedersen and Pincheira (2014), using a sample of 31 OECD countries, report that the global inflation factor improves the inflation forecast for 50% of the countries in the case of headline inflation and for 40% in that of core inflation. Nevertheless, the improvements in the forecasts mentioned in these papers are contained, producing a 5% to 6% reduction in the root mean squared errors.

4. The fourth type of explanation relates to possible non-linearities in the relationship between inflation and real activity. More precisely, the coefficient of the real activity measure in a Phillips curve may depend on the size and duration of economic slack, on the level and volatility of inflation, and on the degree of anchoring of inflation expectations. Specifically:

a. Clark, Laxton and Rose (1996) and Macklem (1997) point to the role of capacity constraints: during recessions, when firms operate below their full capacity, if demand is successfully stimulated, firms will be able to produce more without incentives to raise prices. During boom times, when firms operate closer to full capacity, additional demand translates into stronger price increases. Thus, the slope of the Phillips curve is an increasing function of excess demand.

b. Ball, Mankiw and Romer (1988) and Ball and Mankiw (1994) discuss convexity of the Phillips curve in the context of adjustment/menu costs. Ball, Mankiw and Romer (1988) show that in a new-Keynesian framework the frequency of price changes increases when the average rate of inflation increases, because firms must adjust their prices more frequently to keep up with the general rise in prices. As a consequence, the slope of the Phillips curve increases with the level of inflation.

c. Stiglitz (1986), Fisher (1989) and Akerlof, Dickens and Perry (1996) developed models with downward wage and price rigidities. These models embed the fact that workers are more reluctant to accept a decrease in their wages than an increase. At times of excess supply, the slope of the Phillips curve becomes an increasing function of the level of inflation.

The theories that imply convexity rationalise relatively stronger expansionary monetary policy action during times of recession (as price pressures induced by expansionary policy are expected to be smaller during recessions).

The consequences for monetary policy of the weakening of the link between the level of economic activity and inflation, if this weakening indeed happened, would be significant. First, it has consequences on the sacrifice ratio: if inflation increases as a result of shocks not related to domestic slack, then the cost of bringing inflation down in terms of output loss would increase sharply. Second, if instead inflation becomes very low, monetary policy would have to stimulate economic activity more strongly and could lack effective instruments to do so. In sum, a flatter slope of the Phillips curve makes controlling inflation either more costly or more difficult. Naturally, when that flattening is associated with more strongly anchored expectations, the difficulties are mitigated.

What this underlines is the need to carefully monitor the relative importance of different drivers of domestic inflation: inertia, expectations, economic slack, supply shocks and external variables. Several methods and models are necessary for the task, as policy makers cannot rely on the perspective provided by a single tool.

Nevertheless, the fact remains that forecasters were not able to anticipate the disinflation for the euro area as a whole from 2012, or for the larger member countries. This is particularly surprising because forecasters did take into account the fall in economic activity in most euro area countries after 2011, which generated significant gaps between actual and potential output. The ECB has not been alone in over-predicting euro area inflation. The IMF, ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF), Consensus Economics, Euro Zone Barometer, OECD and European Commission have also systematically over-predicted both headline and core inflation at all horizons, especially since the second quarter of 2012.

However, as policy makers we need more than just good inflation forecasts: we also need to understand the inflation process in order to better assess the role of monetary policy. We also need to be able to explain our reasoning to the public, as the management of expectations has become such an important monetary policy instrument. This is one more reason for continuing to use the Phillips curve as a tool to discuss inflation dynamics.

The current attention to the relationship between inflation and economic slack has led to an intense debate on the stability of the Phillips curve and its power to explain the twin puzzle. Empirical research, especially in the United States, shows that the slope of the Phillips curve has varied over time, with a clear tendency to flatten over the years.

For the euro area, the evidence from several recent papers points to a steepening in recent years (see e.g. Oinonen and Paloviita (2014), Riggi and Venditti (2015) and Foroni and Porqueddu (2015)). This development is especially marked in those countries which experienced deeper and longer recessions and made greater efforts to reform their product and labour markets, with an impact on nominal rigidities (see, for Italy, Riggi and Santoro (2015) and, to a lesser extent, for Spain, Banco de España (2013 and 2015). When analysing the excessive disinflation in the euro area since 2012, natural questions arise as to whether we are facing a new regime of low inflation (e.g. due to demographics, integration of low-cost countries in global trade, less powerful trade unions, dominance of a service economy), and whether the Phillips curve (and “which” Phillips curve) is still an appropriate framework of analysis.

A number of technical issues pertaining to the Phillips curve have not yet been settled in the literature.

a. A key problem in this debate is that single-equation estimates of the Phillips curve might not correctly identify its slope, as inflation and economic slack are determined simultaneously.

b. Moreover, economic slack is a multidimensional concept that is not directly observable and choices must be made on how to estimate or measure it.

c. An additional problem is that inflation is also influenced by foreign shocks, either directly via imported inflation or indirectly via global economic slack, as a consequence of international integration of production. How do we account for such external shocks?

d. Further, the standard hybrid New Keynesian Phillips curve includes agents’ inflation expectations, which are also difficult to measure. Recent work by Coibion and Gorodnichenko (2015) uses expectations from surveys, with some practical success. It highlights that the choice of the measure of inflation expectations is crucial in understanding inflation dynamics in the United States, advocating the use of surveys of household inflation expectations rather than those of professional forecasters. Naturally, expectations from surveys or professional forecasters are not microfounded. More generally, NKPC has had many problems to predict inflation even when embedded in a DSGE model. As King and Watson (2012) highlight when using the labour income share or unit labour costs the models do not capture that the last 15 years do not show a co-movement of inflation with the significant decline of those ULCs. Gürkaynak, Kisacikoglu and Rossi (2013) also illustrate the subpar performance of DSGE models to forecast inflation. In their encompassing survey Mavroeidis, Plagborg-Møller, and J. Stock (2014), also conclude that without rejecting the NKPC, “we are unable to pin down the role of expectations in the inflation process sufficiently accurately for the results to be useful for policy analysis”.

e. Finally there is the question of stability of Phillips curve parameters, in the form of non-linearities or structural changes. As sudden decreases in forecasting ability are frequently associated with instability, a plausible explanation for the recent inflation surprises is a change in the slope of the Phillips curve. In what follows I am going to show some robustness analysis of the Phillips curve. Let us focus on slack.

Economic slack is the great unknown: it is unobservable and is highly sensitive to the assumptions used for the decomposition of economic activity into trend and cycle. Usual measures of slack can vary substantially across methods and variable inclusion, although they tend to agree on the timing of peaks and troughs.

The fact that economic activity is multidimensional suggests that there might be advantages in using large dynamic models to estimate it. For instance, ECB staff used a dynamic factor model that performs a trend/cycle decomposition of real activity variables and core inflation. [4] The model uses a single factor to capture common cyclical fluctuations and estimates the output gap as the deviation of output from its trend. Different modelling assumptions, such as different sets of real activity indicators and different specifications of the trend components of the variables, lead to different estimates of the output gap. These differences are economically very relevant, with some models estimating an output gap that was close to zero in 2014 on average, and others estimating remaining slack of as much as -6%.

One way to discriminate among different estimates of the output gap is to check their ability to forecast inflation. It turns out that the variants associated with a continuation of a positive growth trend, implying a wider output gap, are the ones that produce better inflation forecasts. The best variant from this perspective implies that the output gap was as large as -6% in 2014 (see the left-hand chart of Figure 4). Assuming the opposite, namely a break in the output trend, which we could call a secular-stagnation hypothesis, leads to a much poorer forecast ability of recent inflation. The output gap estimated by the IMF and the European Commission are halfway between the extremes arising from the dynamic factor model I have described (see right-hand chart of Figure 4).

Taking into account uncertainty over how to measure slack and inflation expectations, the Phillips curve is alive and well in the euro area (in some form). The dynamic factor model just discussed is not the only one that can explain the recent excessive disinflation. ECB staff have conducted a specification search with a hybrid NKPC using different measures of slack and of inflation expectations, and also including import prices as a measure of external shocks.

Several specifications are indeed able to track the recent disinflation. The results are shown in Figure 5, where each grey line is the conditional out-of-sample projection of inflation excluding energy and food, based on its own lag, lagged import prices, a measure of slack (lagged) and a measure of inflation expectations. The projection is based on the realized values of the explanatory variables except for lagged inflation, which is determined dynamically. While indeed many models pointed to inflation increasing faster than it did, some are able to track the disinflation quite well. These models tend to be those that use the unemployment rate (or gap) and a short to medium-term measure of inflation expectations.

The result holds also for conditional forecasts that start earlier, through the financial crisis and since the first recovery. In fact, the best specifications of the same hybrid NKPC were evaluated by looking at out-of-sample dynamic projections of inflation over the period up to end-2014 based on two different estimation samples, one ending in 2007 and the other in 2009. Figure 6 shows that the results are satisfactory for both exercises.

However, as I have already hinted, the coefficients of the Phillips curve may not be stable. As I mentioned above, the slope of the Phillips curve might have increased over the period when we were over-predicting inflation. Running the same specifications just described over two samples, one stopping at 2012 Q1 (when we started to systematically over-predict inflation excluding food and energy) and the other covering the full sample ending in 2014 Q4, there is some evidence of an increase in the slope estimate. This suggests the specific possibility of non-linearities that could be due to state-dependency of the Phillips curve or to structural change of some form. Indeed, regime-switching estimates, accounting for parameter change due to state-dependency on various measures of the business cycle can help to explain the “excessive” disinflation since 2012. The results are shown in Figure 7 below.

How much time variation is there in the slope of the Phillips curve, and in which direction? The discussion on the steepening or flattening of the Phillips curve brings me to recent discussions that pointed to a flattening, particularly for the United States, but also for various other advanced economies. Let us take an agnostic view on the origins of the time-variation (that is, without necessarily making it conditional upon regimes identified by a specific variable) and estimate a hybrid NKPC with time-varying parameters, similar to that in Blanchard et al. (2015). Over the sample period running from 1999 Q1 to 2015 Q2, the slope of headline inflation had a general tendency to decrease until 2011, after which it rebounded (see the left-hand chart in Figure 8). For core inflation the upward shift started earlier (see the right-hand chart in Figure 8). This is true for the euro area as a whole but particularly valid for some countries that experienced longer recessions and made greater efforts to reform their product and labour markets with an impact on nominal rigidities.

Some variation is also visible in the estimates of the other parameters, with the weight on expectations increasing over most of the 2000s relative to the level of persistence, and the effect of the exchange rate, but not relative to the level of import prices in US dollars, which slightly increased over time.

The impact of the change in the central parameter estimates on conditional predictions is not negligible. Indeed, estimating this model with constant and with time-varying parameters and feeding it with technical assumptions based on the June ECB staff macroeconomic projections for import prices, exchange rates and the measure of slack (i.e. the unemployment rate, as the gap is estimated endogenously within the model), as well as for projected inflation expectations, yields a significantly steeper profile for inflation excluding food and energy over the next two-and-a-half years (Figure 10). The steepening of the Phillips curve also helps improve its ability to fit the low inflation episode, together with the use of measures that indicate wider negative slack and short- to medium-term survey inflation expectations.

Inflation dynamics since the Great Recession have shown signs of instability that have led to a sequence of systematic forecast errors. The two puzzles of “missing disinflation” and successive “excessive disinflation” triggered a surge of new research around the Phillips curve and its possible demise, which seems to have been prematurely foretold.

There is an important common factor in inflation in the advanced economies that helps explain national inflation dynamics. The current phase of low inflation, aside from commodity price developments, is significantly influenced by negative demand shocks both at the global and national level.

In particular, the recent low inflation in the euro area was largely triggered by domestic demand weakness, which probably led to a larger degree of economic slack than was predicted by the usual methods.

The Phillips curve seems to survive the recent reassessment and is still a valid tool of analysis in the euro area, meaning that a sustained recovery in inflation is conditional upon real activity and inflation expectations.

The link between inflation and real activity appears to have strengthened in the euro area recently. Provided our policies are able to significantly reduce the output gap, we can rely on a material effect to help bring the inflation rate closer to target.

471,"China’s recent devaluation of the renminbi has created waves in global markets, but appears to be in-line with the government’s long-term goal of internationalizing the currency, says Frank Yao, senior portfolio manager of the Neuberger Berman China Equity Fund.

The People’s Bank of China (PBoC), the country’s central bank, has stated that the depreciation was due to a technical change to the manner in which the reference FX rate between the RMB and USD is determined.

In the past, the central bank’s views largely determined the rate, creating some misalignments with the spot rate, which tends to be driven by a combination of supply/demand dynamics and expectations.

In a bid to move to a more market-driven approach, the PBoC explained that the change was intended to be a one-off adjustment to address the misalignments. In a subsequent press conference, the PBoC provided further clarity to its position. Among other things, it reiterated that China’s strong fundamentals should provide good medium-term support for the RMB to continue on a broad direction of appreciation. The PBoC also stated that it is willing to intervene to counteract significant and unjustified moves in the currency.

From our perspective, the PBoC’s move to a more market-oriented exchange rate scheme is an important requisite for the RMB to be considered as a constituent of the IMF’s SDR currency basket, or to serve as a reserve currency more broadly.

The recent adjustments, therefore, likely form part of the Chinese government’s objective to promote further internationalization of the currency. In addition, relatively loose liquidity conditions in recent periods have resulted in some short-term negative pressure on the RMB.

While the depreciation of the currency in recent days has been quicker and more pronounced than our outlook of 1-3% for 2015, it does not cause us undue concern or materially impact our long-term outlook.

We anticipate that the RMB will stabilize in the near term, due in part to the strong year-to-date trade surplus. For the first seven months of 2015, China’s trade surplus stood at over USD300 billion, partly due to the stability of imports and lower cost of imported materials.

This, in conjunction with China’s record foreign currency reserves, should provide a good degree of fundamental support for the RMB in the near term.

Looking ahead, further flexibility in the RMB is probable as the PBoC continues to embark upon its trajectory of market-based financial reforms.

Ironically, while the policy direction is quite clear in this regard, it may also result in additional volatility in the exchange rate, and capital markets more broadly, as the various financial reforms unfold and take shape. We believe that the situation bears monitoring, while also remaining cognizant of the drivers of such volatility."
2314,"Shares of TurboTax maker Intuit (INTU) fell sharply amid a broader market selloff on Friday, one day after the software firm reported earnings that fell short of Wall Street expectations and issued a weaker-than-expected financial outlook.

The stock of the Mountain View, Calif.-based company closed down 13.26% at $89.28 a share, the biggest drop in more than a decade.

Intuit on Thursday reported fourth-quarter net revenue of $696 million for the three-month period ending July 31, below the $735.9 million forecast by Wall Street analysts. The company reported a 5 cents a share quarterly loss, better than the 11-cent loss analysts had projected.

Intuit said it expects revenue of $4.525 billion to $4.6 billion for the current fiscal year. Although those totals would represent growth of 8% to 10%, they were below the $5.04 billion forecast by analysts.

The $3.40 to $3.45 earnings per share guidance Intuit issued for the fiscal year similarly was lower than the $3.82 that analysts expected.

Moving to sharpen its focus on its popular software for personal tax-preparation and small business management, Intuit said it would sell three other product lines. They include Demandforce, an automated marketing and communications software; QuickBase, used for managing company projects and reports; and Quicken, Intuit's initial accounting software.

The planned sales will reduce fiscal year 2016 revenue by approximately $250 million and lower earnings per share by roughly 10 cents, the company said.

""We are fully committed to winning in the cloud, and we're focusing our attention and investments on assets that accelerate our ability to deliver our two strategic goals: first, to be the operating system behind small business success; and second, to do the nation's taxes. With this focus, we have decided to divest Demandforce, QuickBase, and Quicken,"" Intuit President and CEO Brad Smith said in a Thursday conference call with financial analysts.

The mixed financial results, divestment plans and stock decline continue a challenging financial period for Intuit.

Users of top-selling TurboTax protested in January after Intuit announced a change that would effectively force them to buy the most-expensive version of the tax-filing software. The company later backtracked on what would have been a 50% cost increase and agreed to issue refunds.

In February, Intuit briefly suspended electronic filing of state tax returns via TurboTax following a surge in tax-refund theft in 19 states. The company later said the stolen identification data that enabled the theft increase did not result from an Intuit breach."
1068,"A local real estate broker with four decades in the business has a new online venture aimed at building trust between homeowners and contractors.

Woody Hogg, of Mechanicsville brokerage ERA Woody Hogg and Associates, has launched AgentApprovedContractors.com, an online portal for homeowners to find contractors that have been endorsed and deemed trustworthy by local real estate agents.

Hogg said he wanted to create the free service after hearing from homeowners who told him they’d been swindled. He said one case in particular served as a motivator: a local widow whose family said she had been taken advantage of by a roofer who charged her triple the going rate.

“I’ve been a Realtor 45 years, and I’ve had a number of experiences with clients that had bad experiences with contractors,” he said. “Most contractors are honest and reliable, but there are a few out there that taint the industry.”

Hogg said the website is intended to provide the peace of mind that can come from a personal referral, in that carpenters, appraisers and other contractors can only be listed with an endorsement from an agent. The site is free for users, and contractors pay a fee to be listed: about $30 a month, or $330 for a year.

Contractors submit an application with the name of the agent that can vouch for them. Hogg’s site then works to verify the information within three business days.

Since launching in June, the site has compiled more than 50 contractors, whose services range from attorneys to asbestos remediation. Hogg said he started the site with about 10 contractors he has worked with over the years, and he is working to market the site through social media and his own professional network.

Hogg said he hopes to expand the site beyond the Richmond market once its database reaches about 200 listings. He said his ultimate goal is for the site to expand nationwide, with more referrals being made as more contractors sign on.

“We are now at the point where we have contractors contacting us, and we’re hiring some marketing people to really talk to contractors,” he said. “I’ve been a member of ERA Real Estate for about 38 years and I’ve got a network of brokers all around the country that I know, so I’m hopeful that will help, too.”

Hogg said he initially envisioned the site as a marketing tool for agents, who would then drive its database through word of mouth. But he said a slow start prompted him to put the focus on contractors.

“The agents are too busy, and it didn’t work the way I envisioned it would,” he said. “We went back to square one and said, ‘OK, let’s go for contractors.’”

Hogg enlisted TwelveTwo, a Midlothian-based web design firm, to develop the site. He said startup costs have totaled about $7,500.

Hogg said he hopes the site is a time-saver for homeowners and agents, noting his own commitments running a real estate company and serving on the board of a local bank.

“I’ve got a lot of things going on. My wife thinks I’m crazy to do this,” the 70-year-old said. “I just felt like it was something I had to do. I had the idea and it was gnawing at me.

“When we do home inspections, which everybody does today, there’s a lot of contractors that are utilizing that process. We as an industry are always dependent on our relationship with contractors,” he said. “This is just something I felt like I had to do.”"
1673,"The heat is on for prospectors in what could be the next gold rush. According to a recent study in the journal Geothermics, a team of geologists has discovered a mother lode of gold and silver inside super-heated reservoirs within New Zealand’s Taupo Volcanic Zone. Extreme heat from the volcanoes’ magma plumes is heating water, producing acidic underground reservoirs and springs that in turn dissolve the surrounding rock. This then allows the embedded gold and silver to come loose and collect in the water. If successfully drilled, one well could yield as much as $2.7 million in gold a year.

According to lead study author Stuart Simmons, a research professor at the University of Utah’s Energy & Geoscience Institute, gold and silver depositing in hot springs and geothermal wells is nothing new. Apparently this was first discovered over 50 years ago, with New Zealand’s ‘Champagne Pool’ hot spring one of the only places in the world where tourists can actually see this phenomenon happen.

“If you Google ‘Champagne Pool’ online, you will see photos of the striking orange-colored precipitates that deposit around the edge of the pool,” Simmons told FoxNews.com. “Those precipitates are rich in gold, silver, mercury, thallium, arsenic and antimony.”

Related: What the animal world would look like if humans never existed

The road to this new discovery began 15 years ago, when Simmons and a colleague constructed a special device to lower down wells up to 1.8 miles deep, obtaining hot samples of thermal water to determine the concentration of precious minerals.

“After about 5 years, we had some preliminary data on which to make assessments of the amounts of precious metals that might be available,” he recalled. Their work paid off, with the amounts of aqueous gold and silver found in the 18 reservoirs estimated to be tens of thousands of ounces of gold and hundreds of thousands of ounces or more of silver. Now, all they need to do is figure out a way to mine it, which is no easy task considering new equipment would have to be developed that could take the heat (the chloride-rich waters in the underground reservoirs can get as hot as 752 degrees Fahrenheit) and also ensure lasting production.

“It is not really practical to mine gold and silver in a traditional sense inside the geothermal areas,” Simmons said. “Hot boiling water would be encountered in shallow excavations and there would be considerable environmental impact to deal with.”

He explained that there currently isn’t much interest in figuring out ways to mine the minerals since it would disrupt energy production, what with the wells being drilled for steam to power turbines and generate electricity. One solution that was proposed in the study was to mine the reservoirs in intervals after enough gold and silver had accumulated so as to make the disuse of the steam-field worthwhile.

“The more practical thing to do is to attempt to extract the metals from the fluids as they flow through the [existing] surface pipe work,” he said. “The gold and silver are passively accumulating in the shallow parts of the wells and in surface pipe work, so it is not lost.”

So if the new tech is developed, who will reap the financial benefits? Not the researchers who made the discovery – they were in it strictly for the science, according to Simmons.

“The team did the work mainly to get a better understanding of processes of gold and silver deposition in ancient hydrothermal systems that are no longer active but that are host to ore deposits,” he said. “There are many such deposits forming mines and prospects around the Pacific Rim (Japan, Philippines, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, New Zealand, Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Mexico, and the western US). So the aim was to apply our understanding to new discoveries.”

Simmons worked in conjunction with his colleagues at the University of Auckland, New Zealand on the study."
25,"July 26 (Bloomberg) -- European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said policy makers will do whatever is needed to preserve the euro, suggesting they may intervene in bond markets as surging yields in Spain and Italy threaten the existence of the 17-nation currency bloc.

“To the extent that the size of these sovereign premia hamper the functioning of the monetary policy transmission channel, they come within our mandate,” Draghi said in a speech at the Global Investment Conference in London today. “Within our mandate, the ECB is ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro,” he said, adding: “believe me, it will be enough.”

Financial markets surged on speculation the ECB will act to lower Spanish borrowing costs after yields on the nation’s bonds rose to levels that prompted bailouts for Greece, Portugal and Ireland. The ECB reluctantly started buying Spanish and Italian debt in August last year as part of its bond purchase program. The buying had little lasting effect and the ECB suspended the program in March.

“His comments certainly suggest that ECB purchases of Spanish and Italian bonds are back on the table for discussion,” said Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets Europe. “But -- just like last summer -- we would expect any new ECB bond purchases to be temporary and limited until other policies are put in place.”

Spanish yields slumped after Draghi’s remarks, with the rate on the 10-year bond dropping as much as 39 basis points to 6.91 percent. It touched a record 7.69 percent earlier this week. The euro jumped and stocks rose. The single currency climbed as high as $1.2318 after trading at $1.2118 before Draghi spoke. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index gained 2 percent.

The euro may have been buoyed by traders cutting bets on the shared currency falling against the dollar, or so-called short positions. Last week futures traders increased net bets the euro would fall against the greenback to 167,249 contracts, according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.

“There is finally light at the end of the tunnel,” said Chris Rupkey, Chief Financial Economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd in New York. “When the ECB is done there won’t be a short against the euro left on the planet.”

Other economists said it’s unlikely that the ECB will take large-scale action soon, pointing to Europe’s two bailout funds.

“The ECB wants to see government money used first,” said Marco Valli, chief euro-area economist at UniCredit Global Research in Milan. “If that doesn’t work, they will put at stake ECB money.”

ECB Governing Council member Ewald Nowotny yesterday pushed up the euro and stock markets after saying in an interview that there are arguments in favor of giving Europe’s permanent bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism, a banking license. That would enable it to refinance with the ECB, boosting its firepower.

Draghi has rejected that proposal in the past and didn’t refer to it today. Instead, he clearly signaled that ECB bond purchases are back on the agenda by referring specifically to the disruption of policy transmission on markets, said Nick Kounis, head of macro research at ABN Amro in Amsterdam.

“The ECB has always argued that the rationale behind its Securities Markets Program is to improve the functioning of its monetary policy, so there is little doubt that this is the tool he is referring to,” Kounis said.

After buying around 220 billion euros ($270 billion) of government debt, the ECB shelved its purchase program amid mounting resistance from some of its policy makers, particularly those from Germany.

On Dec. 1 last year, he appeared to suggest to the European Parliament that the ECB would ramp up its government bond purchases if European leaders agreed on the then-novel idea of a fiscal compact.

Italy’s 10-year bond yields fell 37 basis points after those comments, only to rise 44 basis points a week later when Draghi downplayed the speculation. The ECB subsequently implemented two three-year loan programs that pumped more than 1 trillion euros into the financial system, helping to ward off a credit crunch.

Draghi said today that markets have underestimated the progress that’s been made in the euro area and that the monetary union is “irreversible.” Leaders have this year inked agreements that aim to push the single currency toward tighter joint budgetary surveillance and a so-called banking union.

“The progress in undertaking deficit control, structural reforms has been remarkable,” Draghi said. “They’ll have to continue doing so, of course, but the pace has been set.”

2107,"Oregon reached a $1.1 million settlement with Insys on Wednesday, resolving allegations that the manufacturer of a powerful opioids used improper tactics to market its product.

Insys makes Subsys, a Schedule II drug approved for cancer pain, according to the Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosemblum’s office.

The state alleges that Subsys was marketed for off-label uses such as noncancer neck and back pain and that it provided “improper financial” incentives to some doctors to increase Subsys prescriptions.

Insys also targeted doctors who weren’t qualified to prescribe Subsys to increase sales, the state said.

“Subsys is a very powerful narcotic that has been approved for only a very specific and narrow use,” Rosenblum said in a press release. “Schedule II drugs have a very high potential for abuse and addiction, and it is unconscionable that a company would promote such a powerful drug for off-label uses as well as misrepresent to doctors the benefits of the drug.”

The settlement requires Insys to pay $533,000 to the state and an additional $567,000 to be paid to a nonprofit or government agency identified by Rosenblum to prevent opioid abuse and misuse in Oregon, according to the press release. Total Oregon Subsys sales for the time period of the investigation were $511,000.

Under the Assurance of Voluntary Compliance, the company agreed to not make any false or misleading claims when marketing Subsys in Oregon and comply with all laws relating to the marketing and promotion of prescription drugs, including federal anti-kickback laws, according to the press release. The company also can’t market Subsys in Oregon as a treatment for mild pain for any cause, unless there are any changes in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved uses of the drug."

HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - A Connecticut factory that produced Ovation guitars for nearly a half century before closing last year will resume making the renowned instruments, thanks to the efforts of factory employees.

Four workers remained on the payroll after the New Hartford plant closed, and one of them, Darren Wallace, spent hundreds of hours of his own time setting up what equipment was left so it would be ready if production ever began again.

After Ovation was sold in December, the new owner planned to move the remaining operations to California but decided to keep them in New Hartford after seeing what Wallace had done. The factory had earned a reputation for turning out high-quality acoustic guitars praised for their tone and craftsmanship. Music legends who have played Ovations include Paul Simon, Cat Stevens, Glen Campbell, John Lennon, Mick Jagger and Eddie Van Halen.

""I knew that ultimately it (Ovation) would be sold, and I wanted to make sure we made a good impression on the new buyer,"" Wallace said.

Fender Musical Instruments Corp. closed the plant in June 2014, saying it was ceasing domestic production because of market conditions and insufficient volume levels while continuing to make less expensive versions in Asia. More than 40 workers lost their jobs, and most of the factory equipment was sold at auction.

But Wallace and others did not give up hope that the factory would reopen, and they successfully pushed to keep repair and servicing operations in New Hartford. Wallace became brand manager for Ovation in Bloomfield at Fender subsidiary KMC Music while the three others retained after the closing repaired and restored guitars sent in by customers.

The repair workers moved into a separate building on the property and set up shop, while most of the main factory building was leased to others. Wallace spent his own time arranging what Ovation equipment was left in the same building as the repair workers, so that it would be ready to go if needed.

When Oxnard, California-based Drum Workshop bought Ovation from KMC Music, the new owner planned to move the remaining equipment to Oxnard and resume U.S. production of the guitars there. But chief executive Chris Lombardi changed his mind after meeting the workers and seeing the production space, Wallace said.

""I'm really happy Chris Lombardi was willing to take a chance on the place,"" Wallace said. ""That wasn't their original intention certainly.""

Wallace will run the plant. Two workers who had been laid off were rehired to build new guitars, and they may get help from time to time from the three repair workers.

The factory has the basic machines and tools needed for production, but the workers will have to build some special equipment to replace machinery and tooling that was removed from the factory after it closed.

Employees have started building prototypes and intend to ramp up production this month. They're also getting ready to produce 50th anniversary editions for next year's Ovation milestone.

While the cheapest Ovation models made in Asian factories generally cost the consumer between $300 and $400, Ovations made in New Hartford will run between $3,000 and $5,000 because of the quality difference, Wallace said.

The European Commission has 25 working days after a deal is filed for a first-stage review. It may extend that by 10 working days to 35 working days, to consider either a company's proposed remedies or an EU member state's request to handle the case.

Most mergers win approval but occasionally the Commission opens a detailed second-stage investigation for up to 90 additional working days, which it may extend to 105 working days.

Under the simplified procedure, the Commission announces the clearance of uncontroversial first-stage mergers without giving any reason for its decision. Cases may be reclassified as non-simplified - that is, ordinary first-stage reviews - until they are approved. (Compiled by Foo Yun Chee)"

GDP growth came in at just 0.2 per cent quarter on quarter and 2 per cent year on year, against forecasts of 0.4 per cent and 2.2 per cent, respectively. The economy grew by 0.9 per cent in the first quarter.

The Australian Treasurer, Joe Hockey, played down lower commodity prices and said: “The transition away from a reliance on mining investment is well under way.

“Quite clearly there is resilience in the Australian economy that other economies that have huge exposure to commodity prices could only wish for,” he added.

2456,"Express, Inc. (NYSE:EXPR) reported that its profit tripled in the second quarter, mainly due to improved sales and higher margins. Earnings easily surpassed consensus forecast and the company further raised its guidance for the full year and gave a strong outlook for the current quarter. EXPR shares climbed roughly 19 percent following the results.

Like many other Mall-based chains, the company has struggled in recent years due to margin-eating promotions and decreasing foot traffic. However, Express CEO David Kornberg said on Wednesday that improved product assortment and management of inventory helped the company to lower the depth and frequency of its promotions. Separately, CFO Perry Pericleous said that the company cut the number of wholesale promotion days to four, from eight one year ago.

Earlier this year, the company reorganized its management team and promoted Mr. Kornberg to Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Pericleous was promoted to Chief Financial Officer in July. Analysts at Nomura stated on Wednesday that the results for the latest quarter indicates the success of the new management.

Express also performed well in comparatively new collection, named Express One Eleven, which drove results. The company reported that its upcoming product launch—an extended line of activewear—will start soon. The company is also making progress in the men’s business, according to Kornberg.

On overall basis, the company posted earnings of $21 million, or 25 cents per share for the quarter, well above $6.9 million, or 8 cents per share, one year ago. Revenue came in at $535.6 million, up 11 percent from the same period last year.

The company managed to boost its gross profit margin from 28.3 percent to 33.1 percent amid fewer discounts and higher sales.

Looking forward, Express is anticipating earnings in the range of 26 cents per share to 29 cents per share for the third quarter, above analysts’ estimate of 25 cents."
1193,"NEW YORK (The Deal) -- Shares of HeartWare International  (HTWR - Get Report) took a tumble after the cardiac medical technology company announced on Tuesday that it would purchase privately owned Valtech Cardio in a mostly stock deal that could be worth up to $860 million.

The Framingham, Mass.-based cardiac device company saw its shares drop Wednesday, at one point hitting a low of $61.85, down 24% from its closing price of $81.81, directly prior to the deal announcement. Shares closed Wednesday at $64.51, down over 21%.

Terms of the transaction call for an upfront payment of 4.4 million HeartWare shares, which would total about $360 million, if calculated on Tuesday's closing price.

In addition, Valtech, based in Yehuda, Israel, is eligible to receive milestone payments of up to $122.7 million, also to be made in shares, and an earn-out payments of $375 million (in cash or stock at HeartWare's discretion) once Valtech products have reached $450 million in sales during the trailing 12 month period. There is also a provision for the issuance of warrants to purchase 850,000 shares of HeartWare at a price of $83.73, linked to the milestone of attaining $75 million in net sales for the trailing 12 months.

The deal is not the first time that HeartWare took an interest in the heart valve replacement device company. In its conference call about the deal on Tuesday evening, HeartWare CEO and President Douglas Godshall noted that HeartWare invested in Valtech two years earlier. He also noted that after evaluating multiple companies for possible deals, ""all roads led back to Valtech.""

Speaking on the same call, HeartWare's CFO Peter McAree noted that the ability to generate near-term revenue will make the transaction manageable. He pointed to the fact that growing Valtech may eat up additional cash, including the likelihood of doubling the target's current spend rate of nearly $15 million per year.

Valtech treats the heart valve diseases mitral and tricuspid valve regurgitation, whose patients often also suffer from advanced heart failure that can speed up due to valvular dysfunction. Patients who suffer from advanced heart failure often receive a ventricular assist device, which HeartWare provides.

Godshall also noted that the privately held company's suite of mitral and tricuspid technology complements HeartWare's platforms of HVAD and MVAD -- two different types of heart pumps -- as well as other pipeline products. The acquisition, he said, expands access to a multi-billion dollar potential valve repair and replacement market."

2153,"Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) has reached a settlement agreement with H5, a California-based e-discovery and litigation services firm. In the settlement, H5 has withdrawn its support from the litigation against Chevron in Ecuador and has assigned its 1.25 percent interest in the $9.5 billion Ecuadorian judgment to Chevron. In 2014, Chevron obtained court-ordered discovery from H5 for the company's role in supporting and advancing the lawsuit led by Steven Donziger, which a federal judge found to be tainted by fraud.

""Chevron is pleased that H5 has ended its association with this scheme,"" said R. Hewitt Pate, Chevron's vice president and general counsel. ""Chevron is also pleased that H5 has taken the further action of disclaiming any interest in the Ecuadorian judgment and relinquishing its interest to Chevron. It remains Chevron's intent to hold accountable those responsible for what a federal judge found to be a fraud.""

H5 became involved in the case in 2009, supporting a variety of activities. It helped enlist funding from Burford Capital Limited, a U.K.-based litigation funder, and James Russell DeLeon, a Gibraltar-based businessman. It also played an integral role in bringing the Patton Boggs law firm into the case to provide legal support. Burford, DeLeon and Patton Boggs have all since withdrawn their support from the fraudulent lawsuit and settled with Chevron. H5 also assisted Donziger's team in responding to Chevron's discovery related to the Cabrera Report, an Ecuadorian court-ordered damages report that a U.S. federal court later found was secretly authored by Donziger and Stratus Consulting, a Colorado-based environmental consulting firm. Stratus has also subsequently settled with Chevron.

On March 4, 2014, Judge Lewis Kaplan of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled that the $9.5 billion judgment against Chevron in Ecuador was the product of fraud and racketeering activity, finding it unenforceable in the United States and holding Steven Donziger liable for RICO violations.

""Today's agreement with Chevron resolves all outstanding issues relating to H5 in the Lago Agrio matter. Beginning in 2009, H5 proceeded in good faith to provide a variety of electronic discovery and advisory services in relation to the Lago Agrio case in Ecuador. In this as in other matters, H5 was called on because of our expertise in complex litigation and investigations globally. Last year, Chevron obtained a ruling in its favor from U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan in New York. Although H5 was not a party to that lawsuit, H5 has reviewed Judge Kaplan's extensive findings. In view of those findings, among other reasons, H5 has decided it does not want to profit from the Ecuadorian Judgment and is therefore relinquishing any interest in the judgment.""

In settling this matter, H5 is the latest party to disassociate from Donziger and the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs. In addition to the withdrawal of Woodsford, Burford and DeLeon, who all repudiated the unethical tactics of Donziger and abandoned their financial interest in the fraudulent lawsuit, more than a dozen former insiders and allies testified against Donziger, including his former co-counsel, environmental consultants, funders, employees and Ecuadorian collaborators.

Chevron still has claims pending in Gibraltar against Amazonia Recovery Ltd., a Gibraltar-based company set up to receive and distribute funds resulting from the Ecuadorian judgment, and Pablo Fajardo, Luis Yanza and Ermel Chavez, who are directors of the company. Chevron has alleged that Amazonia is merely a vehicle to perpetuate the ongoing fraud.

Chevron Corporation is one of the world's leading integrated energy companies. The company is involved in virtually every facet of the energy industry. Chevron explores for, produces and transports crude oil and natural gas; refines, markets and distributes transportation fuels and lubricants; manufactures and sells petrochemicals and additives; generates power and produces geothermal energy; and develops and deploys technologies that enhance business value in every aspect of the company's operations.

2210,"NSW Supreme Court provides guidance for administrators as to the law regarding material omission or misstatement in administrators’ section 439A reports.

Mr Ryan was the sole shareholder and director of Recycling Holdings Pty Ltd (the Company). Liquidators were appointed to the Company and the liquidator appointed voluntary administrators pursuant to s436B of the Corporations Act 2001.

At the time of the liquidation, the Company was pursuing a claim against three of its creditors (Salmat, Mediaforce and Fuji) for breaches of exclusivity clauses in service contracts. In that proceeding, Salmat, Mediaforce and Fuji had brought a cross claim against the Company (amongst others) in respect of unpaid monies.

In October 2014, at the second creditors meeting, a resolution was carried that the Company execute a DOCA. The effect of the DOCA was to:

If everything went to plan, the creditors were to receive a dividend of 100 cents in the dollar. If the anticipated proceeds of the litigation materially changed and the creditors were to receive less than 100 cents in the dollar, the creditors could terminate the DOCA.

Just under two months later, Salmat, Mediaforce and Fuji commenced proceedings for orders to:

The orders were sought on the basis that there were material omissions from, or misstatements in the information provided to creditors in the administrators’ s439A(4) report and at the second creditors’ meeting.

What were the material omissions?

Misstatements and omissions regarding the litigation

The creditors contended that that the administrators’ report omitted a number of vital pieces of information about the litigation including information about the merits and the existence of a conflict of interest which created an incentive to settle the claim.

The Court found that the failure to properly inform the creditors about facts known to or reasonably discoverable by the administrators about the litigation was a material omission.

The creditors also contended, and the Court agreed, that the administrators had failed to investigate or disclose in their report a potential unfair preference or uncommercial transaction recoverable from Mr Ryan of up to $500,000 and that this was a material omission.

Brereton J suggested that where there has been a material omission, it does not follow that the court is predisposed in favour of termination.  Relevant considerations include:

Given the relatively unusual circumstances of this case, Brereton J refused to exercise his discretion on the basis that the DOCA would likely have been approved by the creditors whether or not the omitted information had been disclosed and it was not oppressive or unfairly prejudicial to or unfairly discriminatory against one or more creditors, or contrary to the interests of creditors as a whole.

On his view, under the DOCA, the creditors would either receive 100 cents in the dollar as a result of the litigation, or, have the option of terminating the DOCA and pursuing the voidable transactions.

Salmat, Mediaforce and Fuji argued that the administrators should be removed because of a perceived bias based on:

Ultimately the Court held that the matters discussed and the actions of the administrators did not lead to a reasonable apprehension of bias.

Brereton J confirmed that pre-appointment discussions will not be unreasonable if they involve a discussion of the potential terms of a DOCA with the proponent. In his Honour’s view, it is to be expected that administrators will form some preliminary views in respect of a DOCA and that predisposition towards a DOCA – particularly in the context of an appointment by a liquidator does not indicate disqualifying bias in favour of one interest or against another.

This decision is a reminder that while material omissions in a DOCA should be avoided, they will not always be fatal.  Further, a reasonable perception of bias will not necessarily arise in circumstances where an administrator has conveyed their preliminary views on a DOCA to the DOCA’s proponent prior to the administrator’s appointment."
2035,"Former Tesco chief executive Philip Clarke is set to be questioned by the Serious Fraud Office as it nears the conclusion of an investigation into a multi-million-pound accounting scandal at the retailer.

Clarke, who left Tesco in August last year after overseeing a dive in sales and profits, will be interviewed under caution by the SFO, meaning that any testimony he gives can be used in evidence. Tesco’s former commercial director, Kevin Grace, has also been called in, according to Bloomberg which first reported the story. 



Related: Accountancy watchdog to focus on suppliers after Tesco profits scandal

The SFO kicked off a criminal investigation into accounting practices at Tesco in October 2014 after the company admitted that it had overstated profits by £263m because it had incorrectly booked payments from suppliers, for reasons such as marketing costs or reaching sales target. Some Tesco suppliers and other directors including Carl Rogberg, the former UK finance director, Laurie McIlwee, the former group finance director, are also believed to have had contact with the SFO earlier this year.

The issue is also being investigated by the grocery market watchdog – the Groceries Code Adjudicator – and the accountancy watchdog, the Financial Reporting Council.

The profit black hole emerged just weeks after the arrival of new chief executive Dave Lewis, who was brought in to turn around falling sales and profits at Britain’s biggest retailer.



After a whistleblower alerted Lewis, a team of forensic accountants from Deloitte established that Tesco had artificially inflated an estimate of first-half profits given to the City in August last year. They found similar practices had been in place in prior reporting periods. In April this year, Tesco said it had found another £60m more in mis-statements from previous years, mostly as a result of an audit of its Irish operations.

Tesco declined to comment on Thursday but has previously said that it would fully co-operate with the SFO. Earlier this year, that led to speculation that the supermarket could be one of the first companies in the UK to strike a new type of deal with the SFO which would enable it to avoid a criminal prosecution. SFO director, David Green, has said he expects the investigation into Tesco will be resolved by the end of this year.

Under new powers introduced last year, the SFO can offer a “deferred prosecution agreement” (DPA), which requires high court approval. It includes fines and other undertakings, if that is considered to be in the public interest and a company cooperates. 



In May, Ben Morgan, the SFO’s joint head of bribery and corruption, revealed that the watchdog had handed out its first invitation letters for companies to enter into DPA negotiations. A DPA deal does not protect individuals who might face criminal charges with the help of evidence provided by the company.

Clarke joined Tesco as a schoolboy shelf-stacker in 1974. His father also worked for the business. He took over from long-term Tesco boss, Terry Leahy, in 2011 and spent more than £1bn revamping the chain’s UK stores and product ranges. Yet he failed to spot rising competition from discounters such as Aldi and Lidl early enough or to stem the tide of shopper defections to rivals. 



The announcement of his departure last summer came as a surprise for Clarke, who was preparing to celebrate his 40th year at the company with a party in central London. Clarke said it was an “emotional” time but that he had “nothing to regret” during his three-year reign.

Clarke was paid £1.2m for loss of office. Tesco tried and failed to withhold that payment, and another to McIlwee, while it carried out an investigation into the accounting scandal. It has said would seek to recover the money if either was found to have been guilty of gross misconduct. “We have explicitly reserved the company’s rights to pursue recovery of these payments,” the retailer said in its annual report published in May.

Tesco continues to endure a difficult period. Worries about poor trading and difficulties with planned sales of its South Korean and Clubcard business have driven the company’s shares down more than 12% in the past month alone.

The retailer slumped to a record annual loss of £6.4bn when it announced it had axed nearly 5,000 head office and UK store management jobs, as well as more than 4,000 roles overseas and at the group’s banking division. A further 2,500 jobs were lost with the closure of 43 Tesco stores earlier this month."

840,"Mirna Therapeutics Inc. has filed its paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to conduct an initial public offering (IPO) for its shares. The company has applied to list its common stock on The Nasdaq Global Market under the MIRN ticker.

No price range nor a number of shares have been indicated. Still, Mirna Therapeutics’ filing has a proposed amount of up to $80.5 million that can be raised. That can of course change prior to the pricing and opening of the IPO.

Citigroup and Leerink Partners were listed as the joint book-running managers, and Oppenheimer and Cantor Fitzgerald were listed as co-managers in the underwriting syndicate.

Mirna is a clinical-stage biopharma outfit which is developing a broad pipeline of microRNA-based oncology therapeutics. microRNAs are said to be naturally occurring, short ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules which play a critical role in regulating key biological pathways.

The company’s drug pipeline has one Phase I study for solid tumor like HCC, Melanoma, SCLC and NSCLC. Another Phase I was shown to be in hematological malignancies for lymphoma and multiple myeloma. Another four programs were shown to be in the discovery and preclinical stages. The company said in its filing:

Misexpression of even a single microRNA can contribute to disease development and tumor suppressor microRNAs are commonly reduced in cancer. Our scientists and others at leading academic institutions have identified numerous tumor suppressor microRNAs that play key roles in preventing normal cells from becoming cancerous and facilitating proper cancer immunosurveillance. We are developing mimics of naturally occurring microRNAs that are designed to restore this tumor suppressor activity and aid appropriate tumor immune response. This approach is known as microRNA replacement therapy. Our lead product candidate, MRX34, a mimic of naturally occurring microRNA-34 (miR-34) encapsulated in a liposomal nanoparticle formulation, is the first microRNA mimic to enter clinical development and has shown preliminary clinical evidence of anti-tumor activity as a single agent in our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial. miR-34 is one of the most widely published microRNAs and considered a key regulator of oncogenic pathways. We plan to develop MRX34 as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapeutic modalities, such as targeted therapies and immuno-oncology agents. We believe that microRNA mimics represent a new paradigm in cancer therapy and have the potential to create a new, important class of effective cancer drugs, that can potentially be used alone or in combination with other cancer therapeutics. We are led by a management team with extensive experience in the biopharmaceutical industry. Members of our management team have played key roles at prior companies, including Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Pfizer Inc., Reata Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and EMD Serono, Inc. Our principal investors are funds managed by Sofinnova Ventures, New Enterprise Associates, Pfizer Venture Investments, Eastern Capital, Baxalta, Santé Ventures, Morningside Ventures and Celgene.

Since the first quarter of 2013, IHS said it has spent $500 million across Africa on power systems. The money has been allocated to deploy advanced generators, batteries and alternative power solutions to reduce diesel consumption, IHS said. “By the end of 2016, up to 80% of all IHS towers will be run on hybrid solar solutions.

IHS said: “This green source of energy is ideal for the region, where towers are required in often isolated rural areas with little or no access to the electricity grid but ready supplies of sunshine. In our part of the world, solar-powered towers are not only potentially more environmentally friendly but also more reliable and efficient.”

A joint report published in 2012 by the World Bank and African Development Bank, with support from the African Union, said that, at the start of 2012, Africa’s mobile telephony market was “bigger than either the EU or the US. Some 68,000 kilometres of submarine cable and over 615,000 kilometres of “national backbone networks” had already been laid to boost connectivity across the continent, the report said.

In August 2014, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), part of the World Bank Group, announced a $1m advisory services agreement with Airtel Zambia to increase access to mobile financial services in the Zambian market. The project is part of a $37.4m joint initiative of IFC and The MasterCard Foundation to expand microfinance and advance mobile financial services in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).

A report published earlier this year by The Boston Consulting Group said that SSA is adopting mobile financial services “at a pace seen in few other places, presenting banks and mobile-network operators with a set of strategic choices that will go a long way toward determining their success in the region”.

According to the report, the value of the region’s mobile money market could grow to $1.5 billion over the next four years as Africa’s ‘unbanked’ use their phones for a variety of financial transactions."
